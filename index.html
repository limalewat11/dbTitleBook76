Unlike approaches that focus on changing specific behavior, Dr. Greenspan's program promotes the building blocks of healthy emotional and behavioral development, showing that children with ASD do not have a fixed, limited potential, and may often join their peers to lead full, healthy lives. With practical advice for every scenario you may face with your autistic child at any age -- including sensory craving, overactivity, avoidant behavior, eating, toilet training, developing social skills and more -- <i>Engaging Autism </i>offers hope for families and redefines how we see children with ASD. <br></p><p><b>Stanley I. Greenspan, MD</b>, was a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at George Washington University Medical School. His books include <i>The Growth of the Mind</i>, <i>The Challenging Child</i>, and <i>The Child with Special Needs</i>. He died in 2010.<br><br><b>Serena Wieder, PhD</b>, is the Clinical Director and a founding member of the Profectum Foundation and the cofounder of the Interdisciplinary Council on Development and Learning Disorders.<br>Greenspan and Wieder (The Child with Special Needs) start out by redefining autism in realistic yet positive terms which open the door for successful intervention: instead of focusing solely on the autistic spectrum, a more flexible axis measuring progress, on which placement is not fixed, can give parents and children a "a healthy developmental trajectory," taking into account such goals as "showing intimacy and warmth ... communicating with gestures ... and talking meaningfully." The authors give readers a pragmatic approach to thinking about people on the autistic spectrum, including specific ideas for enhancing connectivity and communication in people of any age, most of whom "rarely advance intellectually above the ten-to-twelve-year-old level ... when they could progress far beyond the level of concrete thinking," if only there were a curriculum that would "challenge them to do so." Most of the text is used to help develop an engaging program for someone with autism, including resources and examples, in order to address "relationships, specific behaviors, the creative use of ideas, and the various processing areas." This is essential reading for caregivers, parents and friends of people on the spectrum, as well as compelling reading for anyone who wants to learn more about autism.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is run by Irfan Dama, an animated chef of forty-one, who designs three-course meals that alternate daily. Baadal is his first restaurant. Yet by all accounts, it is a colossal success. Within just days of opening, reservations were nearly impossible to secure.</p><p>Unlike more traditional Indian restaurants, Chef Dama&#x2019;s menus aim to demystify meals that often intimidate novice diners, by listing every ingredient included in a dish. The restaurant&#x2019;s decor also provides a range of dining experiences, from quiet booths surrounded by sheer curtains to open-space tables to a rousing Bollywood-themed room intended for group celebrations.</p><p>There&#x2019;s one other thing that&#x2019;s different about Irfan Dama&#x2019;s restaurant: It doesn&#x2019;t charge customers a penny. In fact, anyone who&#x2019;s had the good fortune of sampling Baadal&#x2019;s world-class cuisine has done so for free.</p><p>Baadal is owned by Google. It is one of the thirty gourmet restaurants that cater to employees at the company&#x2019;s Mountain View headquarters, known as the Googleplex.</p><p>At Google, eating is serious business. Every meal brings with it the opportunity to try over two hundred artisan-crafted dishes. Among the more recent offerings: roast quail, steak tartare, lobster bisque, black cod with parsley pesto and bread crumbs, and porcini-encrusted grass-fed beef. For lighter eaters, there is a salad bar, a noodle bar, a cheese and charcuterie bar, crudit� platters, and seasonal sous vide vegetables. Between meals, Googlers are invited to visit one of the many microkitchens sprinkled throughout the campus, each open 24/7 and stocking organic fruit, yogurts, candy, nuts, and drinks. The goal at Google is for employees to be within three minutes of a food source at all times.</p><p>The vast and complementary food selection is one reason Google was ranked by <i>Fortune</i> magazine as the world&#x2019;s best place to work. But as far as Googleplex amenities go, it&#x2019;s only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Employees at the company are treated to massages, haircuts, eyebrow-shaping services, foreign language courses, and doctor visits, all on site and free of charge. They have access to three wellness centers, a bowling alley, basketball courts, a roller-hockey rink, ping-pong tables, arcade games, foosball tables, a rock-climbing wall, a putting green, and volleyball courts complete with actual sand. There&#x2019;s an indoor tree house, manicured gardens, apiaries for recreational beekeeping, a replica of Richard Branson&#x2019;s private spaceship, and the life-size skeleton of a <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>. Not to be forgotten: the heated toilet seats.</p><p>Google is far from the only organization investing heavily in the comfort of its employees. SAS, a business-analytics software company that earned more than $3 billion in 2012, provides its employees with access to tennis courts, saunas, a billiards hall, heated swimming pools, and work-life counseling, which includes confidential professional advice on financial planning, elder care, and family issues. At Facebook, employees can ride company-provided bicycles to the campus barber, drop off their dry cleaning, grab a latte, raid the free candy shop, and, conveniently, visit the on-site dentist.</p><p>And it&#x2019;s not just companies in high tech. Wegmans, a northeastern U.S. grocery chain, has consistently appeared near the top of <i>Fortune</i> magazine&#x2019;s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For over the past fifteen years. During that same time period, annual sales have nearly tripled. While many retail operations have tried growing earnings by reducing labor costs, Wegmans has steered in the opposite direction, offering its supermarket employees (many of whom are still in high school and simply glad to have a job) wellness programs, pretax spending accounts, 401(k) plans, life insurance, and education scholarships.</p><p>What&#x2019;s the rationale behind all this lavish spending? For many companies on <i>Fortune</i>&#x2019;s list, the basic calculus is simple: <i>Happy employees mean bigger profits.</i></p><p>The more invested and enthusiastic people are about their work, the more successful their organization is on a variety of metrics. Studies indicate that happy employees are more productive, more creative, and provide better client service. They&#x2019;re less likely to quit or call in sick. What&#x2019;s more, they act as brand ambassadors outside the office, spreading positive impressions of their company and attracting star performers to their team.</p><p>The bottom line for many of the world&#x2019;s most profitable organizations is this: Investing in workplace happiness doesn&#x2019;t cost their company money&#x2014;it ensures they stay on top.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a perspective backed by some compelling data. Research conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute&#x2014;the organization that compiles an annual list of leading workplaces in conjunction with <i>Fortune</i> magazine&#x2014;reveals an eye-opening statistic: The stocks of companies on the Best Companies to Work For list outperform the market as a whole by a stunning factor of <i>2 to 1</i>.</p><p>Investors are catching on. Around the time the Googleplex opened its doors in 2004, San Francisco&#x2013;based Parnassus Investments launched a mutual fund comprised exclusively of companies with outstanding workplaces, like the ones on <i>Fortune</i>&#x2019;s list. Since the fund&#x2019;s inception, it&#x2019;s recorded a 9.63 percent annualized return. In comparison, the overall S&amp;P index during that same time period was a considerably more modest 5.58 percent.</p><p>The evidence is clear: Creating an extraordinary workplace can pay significant dividends.</p><p>So how do you do it?</p><p>Google, SAS, Facebook, and Wegmans certainly set a high bar. But what if you don&#x2019;t have the budget of a multinational corporation? What if you&#x2019;re struggling to find room for a bigger copier, let alone the space for an on-site wellness center? What if the closest thing your office has to a gourmet restaurant is the vending machine at the end of the hall?</p><p>What then?</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>This book happened by accident.</p><p>It came about after I left academics, where I&#x2019;d spent years studying human motivation in the lab and teaching psychology at colleges and universities. Shortly after earning a doctorate in social psychology and settling into a teaching position, I found myself restless.</p><p>I&#x2019;d planned on spending my life as a college professor. But the moment I stepped into the role, I began itching for a new challenge. I wanted to do something practical. Something applied. And so I entered the business world, where I was hired to measure public opinion as a pollster.</p><p>Not long after I arrived, I noticed something unexpected. As a social psychologist specializing in human motivation, I&#x2019;d read countless studies on the factors that promote productivity, creativity, and engagement. Yet to my surprise, very few of these findings were being put to use. Much of what I observed&#x2014;from the way organizations hire to the way leaders motivate to the layout and design of most office spaces&#x2014;appeared blind to a wealth of research on how we can build a better workplace.</p><p>Over the past decade, advances in brain imaging, data-gathering methods, and behavioral science experiments have produced powerful insights into the conditions that help us work more effectively. We now know how to build a room that boosts creativity, how to turn workplace colleagues into close friends, and how to make any job more meaningful. We know that decorating your office can make you more productive, that going for a walk can lead to better decisions, and that embracing failure can actually help you succeed.</p><p>Yet most of these findings have remained trapped in library stacks, collecting dust on university shelves.</p><p>In some ways, the knowledge gap between the worlds of business and psychology makes complete sense. Until recently, organizations have had limited need for the advice of psychologists. The traditional workplace, which evolved from the days of the factory floor, had been operating adequately.</p><p>But then something momentous happened: The economy shifted. And suddenly the workplace model we&#x2019;d relied on for generations was no longer as effective.</p><p>Back in the days of the industrial economy, building a successful workplace meant finding efficiencies through eliminating errors, standardizing performance, and squeezing more out of workers. How employees <i>felt</i> while doing their job was of secondary interest, because it had limited impact on their performance. The main thing was that the work got done.</p><p>Today things are different. Our work is infinitely more complex. We rarely need employees to simply do routine, repetitive tasks&#x2014;we also need them to collaborate, plan, and innovate. Building a thriving organization in the current economy demands a great deal more than efficiency. It requires an environment that harnesses intelligence, creativity, and interpersonal skill.</p><p>Businesses today need psychologists. In a world where productivity hinges on the quality of an employee&#x2019;s <i>thinking</i>, psychological factors are no longer secondary. They&#x2019;re at the very core of what determines success.</p><p>Which brings me back to how I unintentionally came upon the idea for this book: After academia I assumed my writing days were over. But as I experienced the business world firsthand, both in the role of employee and manager, and as I interacted with hundreds of clients, getting an unvarnished view of how their organizations operate, one theme kept resurfacing again and again: <i>There is a massive divide between the latest science and the modern workplace.</i></p><p>This book is an attempt to bridge that gap.</p><p>In the chapters that follow, I am going to tell you about revolutionary findings in the fields of motivation, creativity, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and management, and show you how you can use them to create a better workplace. Each chapter will address a different aspect of the workplace, offering illuminating and often counterintuitive best practices for making you and your company more effective.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll learn how to motivate employees without relying on bonuses, how to choose between job applicants, and how to elevate pride in your organization. You&#x2019;ll discover how to reach better spending decisions, how to defuse workplace disagreements, and how to make yourself more persuasive.</p><p>Along the way, we&#x2019;ll meet some extraordinary individuals and hear their fascinating stories, each providing a unique lens for understanding workplace excellence. I&#x2019;m going to take you behind the scenes of a hostage negotiation and demonstrate how verbal techniques used by the FBI can make you a better leader. I&#x2019;ll introduce you to the man who created the cubicle and explain why his vision for the modern workplace makes perfect sense. I&#x2019;ll show you what every organization can learn from the structure of video games, the design of a Las Vegas casino, and the hiring practices of a symphony orchestra.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll cover lots of ground in a short time frame. The work you&#x2019;re about to read fuses thousands of scientific studies in a way that I hope you&#x2019;ll find engaging and relatively jargon-free. I have attempted to write the sort of book I&#x2019;d want to read on a business trip. For me that means three things: fast-paced, entertaining, and actionable.</p><p>I designed this book with two audiences in mind. The first and perhaps most obvious are managers, owners, and CEOs&#x2014;those with the ability to apply many of the research recommendations and immediately transform their team&#x2019;s workplace experience.</p><p>But this book is not merely a playbook for those at the top of the corporate ladder. It is also written for emerging leaders who want data-driven insights for improving their own productivity and lifting their team&#x2019;s performance. Regardless of where you sit on your company&#x2019;s org chart, if you are interested in reaching smarter workplace decisions, having better colleague relationships, and making yourself indispensable to your company, this book can help.</p><p>There are many business books that provide broad principles and few practical recommendations. This is not one of them. Throughout every chapter, you will find specific, evidence-based changes you can apply at your workplace, regardless of your industry. In addition, at the conclusion of each chapter, you will find action items that build upon the findings, offering three more applications geared toward managers and emerging leaders<i>,</i> respectively.</p><p>An unavoidable downside of writing about workplaces <i>in general</i> and offering lots of specific recommendations is that not all of them will be applicable to everyone. Every organization is different. What works for Google may not be ideal for Wegmans, and vice versa. In that vein, some of the suggestions in this book may be perfect for your company, while others may appear less relevant. My intention here is not to offer a one-size-fits-all approach for building a great workplace (because that would be impossible) but to provide you with a menu of proven ingredients, so that you can choose what feels right within the context of your organization.</p><p>By the time you reach the conclusion of this book, I hope to have convinced you of a simple fact: that psychological insight can transform any organization into a great workplace.</p><p>The secret to happy workplaces isn&#x2019;t spending more money. It&#x2019;s about creating the conditions that allow employees to do their best work.</p><p>And how exactly do you do that? Turn the page. The answers, I believe, are here.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Designing an Extraordinary Workplace Experience</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>Success Is Overrated</p><p>Why Great Workplaces Reward Failure</p><p>Silas Johnson never expected to become famous.</p><p>At twenty-nine, he was simply grateful to be playing baseball. Just a few years earlier, he&#x2019;d been slaving away on the family farm, working alongside his dad from the moment the sun hit his lids until the muscles in his back ached. On a good week he and his dad might find a few minutes to escape for a quick game of catch near the old windmill. His days were as predictable as they were long.</p><p>That all changed the morning Si spotted an ad in the Ottawa <i>Republican-Times</i>. The Rock Island Islanders were holding open tryouts.</p><p><i>Why not?</i> he thought. It was worth a shot.</p><p>When he got there, he found himself competing with eighty-one other men&#x2014;enough to fill the entire roster several times over. Si knew he was a long shot. Yet, miraculously, he was the only player offered a permanent spot.</p><p>Now, as a starting pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds, he would tell anyone who would listen: He was just relieved to have found an easier way of earning <i>twenty dollars a month</i>.</p><p>The year was 1935.

And though he had no way of knowing it, he was about to have the single most memorable game of his professional career.</p><p>It started out much like any other day at the ballpark.

Her most recent bestseller, Save Wisely, Spend Happily, was released in 2013 in partnership with the AICPA.So why write <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women</i>?<br> &nbsp;<br> The rules of success are the same for everyone. Why mess with the brilliance of Napoleon Hill&#x2019;s original book, <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>? Why write something special just for women? <br> &nbsp;<br> These questions, and many more, are sure to be asked. In fact, for most of my career, I have felt the same way. I originally read <i>Think and Grow Rich </i>when I was nineteen and have read it many times during my career, and it has had a huge, positive impact on my life. <br> &nbsp;<br> My parents taught me that I could be anyone or do anything I wanted as long as I worked hard and focused on my goals. They had worked hard all their lives and were fabulous role models. It wasn&#x2019;t until I started my career, all alone in a different city, that reality started to set in. It was in the late 1970s and I was one of only a few women in my field. I quickly learned that I definitely had to work harder than my male counterparts if I wanted to get ahead. So I did. <br> &nbsp;<br> No one said it would be easy&#x2014;and it wasn&#x2019;t. No one said it would be a smooth ride&#x2014;and it hasn&#x2019;t been. But the resilience and lessons I learned from facing and surviving the tough times were essential contributors to my success today. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now, more than thirty-five years later, I continue to be amazed by the stories of the incredible businesswomen I meet and how they too, in the face of the glass ceiling or sexual bias, found ways to forge ahead. Many of them had read and followed the teachings of <i>Think and Grow Rich </i>and created great success in their lives, but they have gone even further. They have each taken their success in stride and continued on to open new paths for the women who follow them, evolving their lives of success into lives of significance. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women </i>is a celebration of these women and every woman who has succeeded in spite of the obstacles she has encountered&#x2014;women who have changed history, created great business success, and provided great opportunities for others.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition, there have been some incredible economic developments that have brought greater attention to successful women, and in doing so, have revealed that while the rules may be the same, women approach those rules differently, and they apply them differently than men do. While there is still much progress to be made, there has been a &#x201c;quiet revolution&#x201d; as women have gained momentum in every aspect of life. The following statistics showing the increasing power of women are the most recent available at the time of this writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN THE ECONOMY<br> &nbsp;<br> These financial statistics prove, without a doubt, that women have tremendous power and influence globally. Can you imagine what would happen if women came together and used their economic power to create positive change?<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60 percent of all personal wealth in the United States is held by women.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 85 percent of all consumer purchases in the United States are made by women.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women over the age of fifty have a combined net worth of $19 trillion.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-thirds of consumer wealth in the United States will belong to women in the next decade.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $7 trillion is spent by women in the United States in consumer and business spending.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally, women are responsible for $20 trillion in spending, and that number is expected to rise to $28 trillion by the end of 2014.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally, women stand to inherit 70 percent of the $41 trillion in intergenerational wealth transfer expected over the next forty years.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN EDUCATION<br> &nbsp;<br> The United States Department of Education estimated that in 2013<br> women earned:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 61.6 percent of all associate degrees;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 56.7 percent of all bachelor&#x2019;s degrees;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59.9 percent of all master&#x2019;s degrees;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51.6 percent of all doctorate degrees.<br> &nbsp;<br> In summary, in 2013, 140 women graduated with a college degree at some level for every hundred men.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN THE CORPORATE WORLD<br> &nbsp;<br> While tremendous progress has been made in the lower ranks of management, there is still a great need for women to advance to the higher levels of leadership in corporations, which is evidence that the glass ceiling still needs to be shattered:<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are twenty-three, or 4.6 percent, women CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.8<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women hold 16.9 percent of board seats in the United States, as compared to 40.9 percent in Norway, and 6 percent in Asia.<br> o&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to note that Norway passed a law in 2003 requiring companies to appoint women to 40 percent of board posts.11<br> o&nbsp;&nbsp; A study of companies in the MSCI AC World index, which is an index designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets in twenty-four countries, found that companies with a gender-diverse board outperformed those with only men by 26 percent over six years.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women hold 14.6 percent of executive officer positions.<br> o&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a report by <i>Catalyst </i>titled &#x201c;The Bottom Line: Corporate Performance and Women&#x2019;s Representation on Boards,&#x201d; Fortune 500 companies with the highest representation of women board directors attained significantly higher financial performance, on average, than those with the lowest representation of women board directors. In addition, the report highlights that boards with three or more women directors show notably stronger-than-average performance. It shared three key measurements:<br> &#x25ca; <b>Return on Equity: </b>On average, companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least by <b>53 percent</b>.<br> &#x25ca; <b>Return on Sales: </b>On average, companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least by <b>42 percent</b>.<br> &#x25ca; <b>Return on Invested Capital: </b>On average, companies with the highest percentages of women board directors outperformed those with the least by <b>66 percent.</b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> IN EARNINGS<br> &nbsp;<br> While the overall statistics are still disturbing, when you dig into the detail, a positive trend emerges:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women are paid an average of 77 cents for every dollar men make. In 1970, it was 59 cents. <br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the 77 cents statistic has remained constant over the last few years, a total of sixteen states report that their women are earning 80 cents or more for every dollar men make.<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you exclude self-employed and workers who work only part of the year, in 2012 women earned 80.9 percent as much as men.<br> &nbsp;<br> And a review by age group shows significant improvement for younger women. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics:<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> PAY EQUITY BY AGE<br> &nbsp;<br> Age Groups Women&#x2019;s Percentage of Men&#x2019;s Earnings<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&#x2013;24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 93.2 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25&#x2013;34 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 92.3 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35&#x2013;44 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78.5 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&#x2013;54 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 76.0 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55&#x2013;64 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;75.1 percent<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 80.9 percent<br> &nbsp;<br> � Globally, men&#x2019;s median full-time earnings were 17.6 percent higher than women&#x2019;s in developing countries. The biggest gender wage gap was in Korea and Japan.<br> � Globally, according to a Deloitte study, women&#x2019;s earning power is growing faster than men&#x2019;s in developing countries. Their earned incomes have increased by 8.1 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for men.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN BUSINESS OWNERSHIP<br> &nbsp;<br> More and more women are shunning the corporate world in favor of entrepreneurship, thereby circumventing the impact of the glass ceiling altogether. The &#x201c;State of Women-Owned Businesses Report&#x201d; for 2013 (commissioned by American Express OPEN) reveals:<br> &nbsp;<br> � Between 1997 and 2013, the number of women-owned firms has grown at one and a half times the national average; <br> � The number of women-owned and equally owned firms is nearly 13.6 million and they:<br> &nbsp;<br> � generate more than $2.7 trillion in revenues;<br> � employ nearly 15.9 million people;<br> � represent 46 percent of U.S. firms and contribute 13 percent of total employment and 8 percent of firm revenues.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN POLITICS<br> &nbsp;<br> More women are entering politics than ever before. The following statistics, however, show there is still a far way to go to reach parity with male political leaders. <br> &nbsp;<br> Globally:<br> &nbsp;<br> �There are thirty-two female leaders in countries or self-ruling territories.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the United States, women hold:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.9 percent of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23.4 percent of state-level elective offices.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> As women realize their economic power and start leveraging it, these statistics will continue to improve. In addressing this global shift at the World Economic Forum, the International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s managing director, Christine Lagarde, talked about the power of what she termed &#x201c;inclusive growth.&#x201d; She stated, &#x201c;The evidence is clear, as is the message: when women do better, economies do better.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> While I look at these statistics and applaud the progress women have made, and are making, I realize that there are many other women who still react to them with anger. Is there still progress to be made? Of course there is! Certainly, the fact that the glass ceiling is still holding down the number of women in the top executive positions and corporate boardrooms, as well as the fact that there is still a formidable pay gap between men and women, both continue to challenge women striving to excel in the corporate world. <br> &nbsp;<br> But instead of focusing on the negatives, let&#x2019;s acknowledge the positive accomplishments of women leaders in business, both as corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, in politics and education today, and let&#x2019;s celebrate these women. Celebrate them for their courage, their success, and their leadership. Then let&#x2019;s come together as women to provide mentoring to younger women and tell them that they can be anyone, or do anything they want, as long as they work hard and focus on their goals. Women must help other women to succeed. <br> &nbsp;<br> Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg triggered a media blitz when she called for women to &#x201c;lean in&#x201d; and pursue their careers aggressively. In her book, <i>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead</i>, released in 2013, she encouraged women to adopt traditionally &#x201c;male&#x201d; characteristics like working long hours, taking credit for performance, and being outspoken. <br> &nbsp;<br> Many of her critics pushed back, saying she was an elitist and out of touch with middle-class working women who cannot afford expensive nannies, while others criticized her for focusing on internal issues that women face, rather than the external issues of equal pay and opportunity and condemning current male-dominated corporate executive suites and boardrooms for not inviting more women to join their ranks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both positions have valid issues; instead of criticizing each other, it is time to join forces for the betterment of all women.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of Sheryl&#x2019;s comments about the women, their struggles, and how to overcome them rang very true for me and I would like to share them: <br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout my life, I was told over and over about inequalities in the workplace and how hard it would be to have a career and a family. I rarely heard anything about the ways I might hold myself back. <br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t put on the brakes. Accelerate. Keep your foot on the gas pedal. When more people [women] get in the race, more records will be broken. More female leadership will lead to fairer treatment for <i>all </i>women. <br> &nbsp;<br> As I read her book, I saw Sheryl sharing her own successful career path as a woman, and the decisions that she made along the way, in the hope that it would provide inspiration to other women. One of her strongest messages is that women are taught that they need to limit their drive for power, which in turn limits their own ambitions and as a result often sabotages their careers. <br> &nbsp;<br> I believe many, if not most, women do face self-confidence issues. While one woman may not be able to change the law regarding equal pay and opportunity, every woman can change her own internal dialogue about her ability to be successful. <i>Think and Grow Rich for Women </i>focuses on how women today can shed the chains of old thinking and old paradigms, and confidently create a life of success and significance. <br> &nbsp;<br> I would highlight the fact that what helped successful women succeed in the past may not be the right advice for women seeking success in the future. While I agree that women need to face their own internal struggles, often about work/life balance, I believe that rather than telling women to be more like men, we should highlight the benefits found in female leadership that may be better suited for today&#x2019;s business environment. <br> &nbsp;<br> As women have increased their numbers and influence in the workforce over the last decade, the business world as a whole has also been changing. We have moved from the Industrial Age into the Information Age, and there has been a spiritual change in the way business is done. The Industrial Age was one where competition was king. The competitive environment created a win-lose or dog-eat-dog philosophy in bu...</p><h2>The Age of Walls: How Barriers Between Nations Are Changing Our World (Politics of Place)</h2><p><b>Tim Marshall, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Prisoners of Geography</i>, </b><b>offers &#x201c;a readable primer to many of the biggest problems facing the world&#x201d; (<i>Daily Express</i>, UK) by examining the borders, walls, and boundaries that divide countries and their populations.</b><br><br>The globe has always been a world of walls, from the Great Wall of China to Hadrian&#x2019;s Wall to the Berlin Wall. But a new age of isolationism and economic nationalism is upon us, visible in Trump&#x2019;s obsession with building a wall on the Mexico border, in Britain&#x2019;s Brexit vote, and in many other places as well. China has the great Firewall, holding back Western culture. Europe&#x2019;s countries are walling themselves against immigrants, terrorism, and currency issues. South Africa has heavily gated communities, and massive walls or fences separate people in the Middle East, Korea, Sudan, India, and other places around the world.<br> <br>In fact, more than a third of the world&#x2019;s nation-states have barriers along their borders.

Lynn</p>This book is not mine. I really didn&#x2019;t write it. Like a surrogate mother, I just carried it. It was created by the many families that I&#x2019;ve had the incredible honor to know in my 27 years of working with kids. Their words rose up out of the echoes of fear, laughter, pain, and love that rang off the walls of my office after a shift of working with troubled teens and their families. After hours on most nights, I&#x2019;d sit exhausted and yet exhilarated trying to comprehend the incredible things I&#x2019;d seen that day, madly scribbling notes to save the wise, healing words of these families from slipping through my fingers into oblivion. At night, I&#x2019;d bolt up out of bed to write more as other thoughts and insights of these people exploded through my sleeping brain. Like a frantic messenger, I felt possessed by the thought that I had to tell what I&#x2019;d seen. I wrote this book to get their words out of me so I could sleep again. Once I finished, I couldn&#x2019;t read this book for months, perhaps afraid it would possess me again. Or perhaps frightened that all of those incredible words I was barely hanging onto might have evaporated off the pages. But as I read the book now, I feel calm, for I can see that my work was not so much writing as it was an attempt to capture the simple, powerful humanity of the wonderful people I&#x2019;ve been honored to work with. These folks have gifted me with themselves in so many ways that I can never hope to repay. The best I can do is to pass along their words as gifts to you, wrapped in the wish that so many of these parents expressed: that I tell you their stories of pain, loss, and fear so that you might come to more easily know their joy---the joy of feeling once again lovingly connected to your adolescent child.<p>--Michael J.

Today, we have thecapacity to make films, friends, or money; to spread hope orspread our ideas; to build community or build up movements; to spread misinformation or propagate violence&#x2014;all on a vastly greater scale and with greater potential impact than we did even a few years ago.<br><br>Yes, this is because technology has changed.

The political neophytes who have raised passionate crowds and won stunning victories. The everyday people and organizations who are leaping ahead in this chaotic, hyperconnected world&#x2014;while others fall back.<br><br>This book is about how to navigate and thrive in a world defined by the battle and balancing of two big forces. We call them old power and new power.<br><br><b>Old power</b> works like a currency. It is held by few. Once gained, it is jealously guarded, and the powerful have a substantial store of it to spend. It is closed, inaccessible, and leader-driven. It downloads, and it captures.<br><br><b>New power </b>operates differently, like a current. It is made by many. It is open, participatory, and peer-driven. It uploads, and it distributes. Like water or electricity, it&#x2019;s most forceful when it surges. The goal with new power is not to hoard it but to channel it.<br><br>To start to see how old and new power work, here are three very different stories.<br><br><b>#MeToo vs. Harvey Weinstein<br><br></b>Award seasons after award season, movie producer Harvey Weinstein ruled over Hollywood like a god.<br><br>In fact, between 1966 and 2016, he actually tied with God for the total number of times each was thanked in acceptance speeches on Oscar night&#x2014;thirty four. His films garnered over three hundred Oscar nominations. The Queen made him an honorary Commander of the British Empire.<br><br>Weinstein hoarded his power and spent it like currency to maintain his vaunted position: he could make or break a star, he had huge personal capacity to green-light a project or sink it. He shaped the fortunes of an entire industry&#x2014;and in turn that industry protected him even as he carried out a decades-long spree of alleged sexual harassment and assault. He controlled the media through developing a cozy mutually beneficial relationship based on the favors and access he could grant. He even won the 2017 Los Angeles Press Club &#x201c;Truth Teller&#x201d; award.<br><br>He buffeted himself with an army of lawyers, relying on punishing non-disclosure agreements for those who worked with him and, when necessary, paying off accusers. He hired private security firms&#x2014;staffed with former spies&#x2014;to dig for information on women and journalists with allegations against him. The women he preyed upon mostly kept quiet anyway, out of the very real fear of career consequences, while the men who might have stepped up stood by and did nothing, unwilling to spend their own power on a fight.<br><br>If Harvey Weinstein, and the closed and hierarchical system that held him up, tell a familiar story about old power, then Weinstein&#x2019;s fall, and especially what happened next, tells us a lot about how new power works, and why it matters.<br><br>In the days after news stories broke about Weinstein and his accusers, the actress Alyssa Milano shared the hashtag #MeToo to encourage women to tell their stories of sexual harassment and assault on Twitter. Terri Conn paid attention. In her twenties, as an emerging actress with a role on a soap opera, Conn had been approached by director James Toback to meet in Central Park to talk about a part. Once there, as she reported to CNN, he assaulted her.<br><br>She buried the memory for years. But with the attention on Harvey Weinstein, and the rise of the #MeToo movement, it resurfaced. She finally told her husband, and she started to act. She began by searching Twitter for women who had used both the #MeToo hashtag and #JamesToback. She found others whose stories were frighteningly close to hers. Together they formed a private Twitter group to support one another and find other survivors. Members of this group then took their stories to a journalist at the Los Angeles Times. Within days of an article being published, more than three hundred women came forward with stories of their own about Toback.<br><br>Conn&#x2019;s campaign was one of many. Almost one million tweets used the hashtag #MeToo in forty-eight hours. In just one day, twelve million Facebook comments, posts, and reactions were logged.<br><br>The #MeToo movement surged across the world like a current, with different communities adapting it to take on their own targets. In France it became #BalanceTonPorc (Denounce Your Pig), a campaign to name and shame harassers. In Italy women recounted their stories under the banner #QuellaVoltaChe (The Time That). And it moved from industry to industry. Members of Congress revealed that they, too, had been harassed by their male peers. The UK defense minister was forced to resign. The European Parliament had its #MeToo moment. Business leaders were exposed and toppled. Rallies spilled out onto the streets in cities across the world, from Paris to Vancouver. India debated an effort to expose the predatory behavior of well-known professors. An article in <i>China Daily</i> that seemed to suggest workplace harassment and assault were only Western problems was pulled after a wave of online criticism.<br><br>No one was the boss of this movement, and no one quite knew where it would go next. #MeToo had been born a decade earlier as the work of grassroots activist Tarana Burke, who encouraged women of color who had been sexually assaulted to share their experiences, peer-to-peer, with other survivors. But now the movement felt ownerless&#x2014;and this was the source of its strength. Everyone from enterprising designers who created &#x201c;me too&#x201d; jewelry to aspiring politicians who aligned with #MeToo to seek to channel its energy.<br><br>The most striking thing about #MeToo was the sense of power it gave to its participants: many who had felt for years that they were helpless to stop longtime abusers, or had been afraid of retribution, suddenly found the courage to stand up to them. Every individual story was strengthened by the surge of the much larger current. Each individual act of bravery was, in fact, made by many.<br><br><b>The patient(s) vs. the doctor</b><br><br>The doctor looked up from his computer, stunned. &#x201c;Where didyou learn that word? That&#x2019;s my terminology. When did you go to medical school? I can&#x2019;t see you as a patient anymore if you&#x2019;re going to go on the internet and just learn stuff that you shouldn&#x2019;t be learning.&#x201d;<br><br>Then the doctor fired his patient.The offensive word was &#x201c;tonic-clonic.&#x201d; His patient had let him know that she thought she had experienced a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure. (In the past, she and her doctor had referred to these moments as &#x201c;space-outs,&#x201d; regular seizures that had been causing her serious concern.)<br><br>This patient had learned about her condition through PatientsLikeMe, an online community of over 500,000 people living with more than 2,700 diseases, each of whom shares their personal medical data and experiences with others on the platform, creating tens of millions of data points. Think of it as a massive support group, learning community, and data set, all rolled into one. Patients on the platform have even worked together to crowd-source their own drug trials, such as when a group of ALS patients conducted a test of lithium as a treatment in a fraction of the time it would have taken the health authorities.<br><br>Letitia Browne-James, another member of the community, stumbled upon PatientsLikeMe &#x201c;out of desperation.&#x201d; She had suffered from epilepsy her whole life, enduring frequent and debilitating seizures that were just getting worse. She feared having a seizure in school or in church, while she was acting or dancing, or, as she got older, on a date.<br><br>After she met her future husband, Jonah James Jr., she worried about her wedding day. &#x201c;I prayed really hard, just asking God to allow me to let me make it through that day without having a seizure,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>While her neurologist kept on prescribing the same old medications, she began to confer with community members on the platform, learning for herself about why certain drugs weren&#x2019;t working, and trying to figure out what other options might be possible. Chasing any kind of hope, she was told of the promise of brain surgery as a treatment for people with epilepsy. She discovered that 83 percent of her fellow patients on the platform had reported positive outcomes from this type of treatment, yet it was something she and her doctor had never even discussed.<br><br>So this patient fired her doctor. As a parting request she asked for the name of an epileptologist&#x2014;the type of specialist she had learned about from her patient community. The doctor flipped through papers on his desk and gave her a name. She was aghast. &#x201c;He had had that information there all the time,&#x201d; she said.<br><br><b>The schoolgirl vs. the State Department</b><br><br>Aqsa Mahmood grew up part of a moderate Muslim family in Scotland. She attended good private schools and loved Harry Potter. She was described as someone who didn&#x2019;t know which bus to take to find her way to downtown Glasgow.<br><br>Yet, over time, she became a &#x201c;bedroom radical,&#x201d; falling into a dark online ecosystem of persuasive content and seductive recruiters. Then one day in November, when she was just nineteen years old, she disappeared. When her parents next heard from her, four days later, she was calling them from the Syrian border.<br><br>But this was not the end of her story. Having been recruited into ISIS, she now turned recruiter, mastering the tools of online engagement and enticing others to follow her example. She built a close-knit girl-to-girl network, sending encouragement and offering practical advice for wannabe jihadi women who were preparing to make the journey to Syria: &#x201c;If I could advise you to bring one thing it would be organic coconut oil (maybe grab an extra jar for me as well lol). This is such a helpful product with multi-use&#x2014;body moisturiser/hair oil, etc.&#x201d; When three normal and well-liked girls from Bethnal Green, London, plotted their own departure for Syria, it was Aqsa Mahmood to whom they reached out on Twitter.<br><br>While Aqsa used intimate, peer-to-peer methods to win over recruits, the U.S. government took a very different approach to try to dissuade them. It printed thousands of cartoons of ISIS recruits being fed into a meat grinder and dropped them out of an F-16 fighter jet as it flew over ISIS strongholds in Syria (an approach that had first been widely used a hundred years earlier, during World War I). It tried a digital approach, too, in an attempt to match the Islamic State&#x2019;s online savvy, creating a rather bossy Twitter account&#x2014;replete with an ominous State Department seal&#x2014;that instructed potential jihadis to &#x201c;Think Again Turn Away!&#x201d; This was perhaps not the most persuasive messenger if you&#x2019;re trying to pull radicalized people back from the brink.<br><br>Here again we see old power meeting new power. The U.S. government was relying on a trusty old power playbook, using its superior position to literally drop ideas from on high. Even when using social media, its default is not to engage, but to command. Aqsa is doing something very different. Her makeshift, metastasizing network is participatory and peer-driven. It moves not top-down, but sideways from girl to girl. It is new power at its most effective, and most terrifying.<br><br><b>THE INGREDIENTS OF NEW POWER</b><br><br>What the #MeToo movement, our patients, and a Scottish schoolgirl all have in common is that they figured out how to use today&#x2019;s tools to channel an increasing thirst to participate.<br><br>People have always wanted to take part in the world. Throughout history, movements have surged, people have organized collectively, communities have built collaborative structures to create culture and conduct commerce. There has always been a dialectic between bottom-up and top-down, between hierarchies and networks.<br><br>But until recently, our everyday opportunities to participate and agitate were much more constrained. Thanks to today&#x2019;s ubiquitous connectivity, we can come together and organize ourselves in ways that are geographically boundless and highly distributed and with unprecedented velocity and reach. This hyperconnectedness has given birth to new models and mindsets that are shaping our age, as we&#x2019;ll see in the pages ahead. That&#x2019;s the &#x201c;new&#x201d; in new power.<br><br>A popular thread on Reddit, the link-sharing platform, crowd-sourced memories of growing up in the 1990s, when life felt very different. For those who were there, the posts offered warm nostalgia. For those who weren&#x2019;t yet born, it told stories of an alien world: The anxiety of waiting for your yearbook photo to arrive, which was &#x201c;the only time you saw a picture of you and your friends at school.&#x201d; You only got one shot to get that right, and you never knew how it would turn out. The tension of calling the local radio station, requesting your favorite song, and then waiting, fingers poised on the record button of your tape cassette player, to capture it when it came on. The excitement of stopping by the Blockbuster Video store to rent a movie on the way home. The frustration of going to the library and finding the one book you need has already been taken out or &#x201c;should be in the stacks but can&#x2019;t be found.&#x201d; The tedium of doing math without a calculator because they were banned, the sturdy reasoning being &#x201c;you won&#x2019;t have a calculator in your pocket all the time when you grow up.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, we now have much more than a calculator in our pocket. In today&#x2019;s world, we all have our hands (quite literally) on what we can think of as a new means of participation. And this isn&#x2019;t just changing what we can do, but how we expect to engage.<br><br>These new means of participation&#x2014;and the heightened sense of agency that has come with them&#x2014;are a key ingredient in some of the most impactful models of our time: big businesses like Airbnb and Uber, China&#x2019;s WeChat or Facebook; protest movements like Black Lives Matter, open software systems like GitHub; and terrorist networks like ISIS. They are all channeling new power.<br><br>Think of these as <i>new power models</i>. New power models are enabled by the activity of the crowd&#x2014;without whom these models are just empty vessels. In contrast, old power models are enabled by what people or organizations own, know, or control that nobody else does&#x2014;once old power models lose that, they lose their advantage. Old power models ask of us only that we comply (pay your taxes, do your homework) or consume. New power models demand and allow for more: that we share ideas, create new content (as on YouTube) or assets (as on Etsy), even shape a community (think of the sprawling digital movements resisting the Trump presidency).<br><br>To grasp the essential difference between old and new power models, think of the difference between the two biggest computer games of all time, Tetris and Minecraft.<br><br>You will likely remember the block-based game Tetris, which exploded with the Gameboy craze of the 1990s. The way it worked was simple. Blocks fell down from the top of the screen and the player&#x2019;s job was to make them fit into neat regular lines. They came do...</p><h2>From Heaven: A 28-Day Advent Devotional</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;We live between two mighty events...&#x201d; </b></p><p>Advent is as much about looking back as it is looking ahead&#x2014;back to Christ&#x2019;s incarnation, ahead to His return. <i>From Heaven </i>combines A.

They think about what's wrong instead of what's possible, and this is what <b>Extraordinary Golf</b> teaches: the art of the possible. Drawing on his experience teaching both amateurs and professionals for more than fifteen years, in his clinics around the country, in his Golf in the Kingdom seminars at the Esalen Institute, and at his own School for Extraordinary Golf in California, Shoemaker shows how extraordinary golf can be coached, learned, and practiced, with results not only in people's scores but in their sheer pleasure in the game. Combining a host of practical exercises with an entirely new point of view, he demonstrates how to focus not on the voices in your head but on the reality of golf: the club, the ball, your body, the course - the elements that actually make up your game. He shows how to approach shots creatively, instead of mechanically; how to read greens simply by staying awake; how to develop a powerful and consistent swing by rediscovering trust for your instincts; and how to improve yourself in competition by determining what you're competing for. He also gives simple guidelines on how to coach yourself, your spouse, and your children successfully.</p><p>Fred Shoemaker, who began teaching golf in the seventies, is the founder of Extraordinary Golf�named one of <b>Golf Magazine</b>'s "25 Best Golf Schools" in America. He lectures and conducts workshops around the world for such organizations as the PGA and the LPGA and for major corporations, including Apple Computer, Oracle, and Pfizer.Flouting course etiquette, Shoemaker recommends throwing golf clubs. Golfers who have just dunked a ball in their local water hazard might thank him for the permission, but Shoemaker's point--his only mechanical tip--is not to release anger but to restore the relaxation flowing from a confident swing. Since that feeling rarely returns by tinkering with technique, Shoemaker and his coauthor, brother Pete, stress attitude, much in the manner of Michael Murphy's classic <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i>. (Shoemaker, like Murphy before him, teaches inspirational golf at the Esalen Institute.) Once a legitimate aspirant to the PGA tour, Shoemaker soured on the sport, only to realize much later that his problem was worrying how he looked, rather than playing each shot in the moment. Since getting in that zone obsesses every golfer, Shoemaker's pep talk is sure to find an audience, especially among those who like to mix golf with New Age philosophy. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Sea Monster!

Casey himself is the picture of pride-massive upper body, toothpick ankles, rosy cheeks, enormous sideburns, and a handlebar mustache. He's the essence of nonchalance as he steps up to the plate, acknowledging his adoring fans. Payne alternates panoramic spreads with single scenes facing a white page comprised of a stanza and visual detail. At the climax, an extreme close-up of "mighty Casey," smoke coming out of his ears and gums glistening, is followed by a two-page cyclone of empty air consuming the batter. Notes about Thayer and the poem complete the offering. Christopher Bing's version (Handprint, 2000), with its scrapbook setting, provides an elegant window to a distant event. Patricia Polacco's Casey at the Bat (PaperStar, 1997), with its youthful framing story, creates sympathy for and accessibility to a sandlot tragedy. Payne's version brings its own flavor to the classic poem. While the staging details evoke the past effectively, the humor and drama elicit immediate interest.

Luigi Pirandello's extraordinary final novel begins when Vitangelo Moscarda's wife remarks that Vitangelo's nose tilts to the right. This commonplace interaction spurs the novel's unemployed, wealthy narrator to examine himself, the way he perceives others, and the ways that others perceive him. At first he only notices small differences in how he sees himself and how others do; but his self-examination quickly becomes relentless, dizzying, leading to often darkly comic results as Vitangelo decides that he must demolish that version of himself that others see.<br><br>Pirandello said of his 1926 novel that it "deals with the disintegration of the personality. It arrives at the most extreme conclusions, the farthest consequences." Indeed, its unnerving humor and existential dissection of modern identity find counterparts in Samuel Beckett's <em>Molloy</em> trilogy and the works of Thomas Bernhard and Vladimir Nabokov.</p><p>Luigi Pirandello (1867-1936) was an Italian novelist, short- story writer, and playwright. His best-known works include the novel <em>The Late Mattia Pascal,</em> in which the narrator one day discovers that he has been declared dead, as well as the groundbreaking plays <em>Six Characters in Search of an Author</em> and <em>Henry IV,</em> which prefigured the Theater of the Absurd. In 1926, Pirandello published <em>One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand,</em> which he had been writing for the previous seventeen years. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934.<br><br>William Weaver (1923-2013) was a renowned translator who brought some of the most interesting Italian works into English. He translated Italo Calvino, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Italo Svevo, Umberto Eco, Alberto Moravia, and Elsa Morante, to name just a few, as well as Pirandello's <em>The Late Mattia Pascal.</em> An expert on opera, Weaver lived for many years in a farmhouse in Tuscany and later became a professor of literature at Bard College."Pirandello's novel is philosophical and metaphysical, a close examination of the fundamental question of how we and others see (and delude) ourselves about ourselves (and others) ... A playful, meditative novel, enjoyably seeing its narrator consumed by his obsession."&#x2014;M.A. Orthofer, <em>The Complete Review</em></p><h2>Things I Wish I Knew Before My Mom Died: Coping with Loss Every Day (Bereavement or Grief Gift)</h2><p><p><b><strong>#1 Amazon Best Seller &#x2500; Coping With Loss</strong></b></p><p><strong>The grieving process:</strong>&nbsp;Ty Alexander of&nbsp;<em>Gorgeous in Grey</em>&nbsp;is one of the top bloggers today.

Blaise Dragomir and George Slair exchange letters, telling each other about their families, relating what's going on in school, and finding out that they have lots in common, without ever realizing that theirs is an interspecies friendship. The game is up at the pen-pal picnic, though, when the friends are at first startled but then just happy to meet at last&#x2014;and the teachers plan the same trick for next year. Young readers will enjoy being in on the secret that this tale's characters don't know about; adding to the fun are Montalvo's bright, detailed, and at times wonderfully chaotic depictions of childhood. VERDICT Funk's title is perfect for classes undertaking a pen-pal unit, but general picture book collections can benefit from this gentle reminder that kids who look different can still get along.&#x2014;Henrietta Verma, National Information Standards Organization, Baltimore</p><h2>The Art of Focused Conversation: 100 Ways to Access Group Wisdom in the Workplace (ICA)</h2><p><p><strong> The best 'how-to' for encouraging consensus in firms and organizations. </strong></p><p> Communication within many organizations has been reduced to email, electronic file transfer, and hasty sound bytes at hurried meetings.

Houser, the owner-operator of the Red Crown Tavern and its adjoining two-cabin motor court, was suspicious from the moment Blanche Barrow walked into his office on July 18 and asked to rent the cabins overnight for a party of three. For one thing, Blanche was wearing her beloved "riding breeches" -- jodhpurs was the correct fashion term -- that were skintight across the rear and flared out from the hip to the knee. Pants like that were seldom seen in Platte City, Missouri, and several people who saw Blanche there were still remarking about them decades later. Then she paid the $4 rent in loose change, undoubtedly looted earlier in the day from the cash registers and gum machines at the three service stations in Fort Dodge. Houser took the money and watched as the fellow driving the Ford V-8 pulled up to the cabins, opened the door of the garage between them, and backed his car in. Criminals were notorious for doing that so they could make fast getaways. </p><p> Clyde got Bonnie settled in the right-hand cabin. W. D. Jones joined them there as usual. Buck and Blanche took the cabin on the left. Almost as soon as everyone was inside, Clyde sent for Blanche. He gave her more loose change and told her to go over to the tavern and buy five dinners and beer. She was to bring the food back so they could eat in the cabins. Blanche reminded Clyde that they'd just checked in as a party of three. Buying five meals would be a tip-off that there were more of them than that. But Clyde said he didn't care -- she was to get five dinners, period, and he wanted chicken if they had it. Blanche did as she was told, and as she poured more coins into his palm Houser said he'd have to go back to the cabins with her. He'd forgotten to take down the license number of their car, and it was required information from all their guests. Feeling helpless, Blanche led him back to the right-hand cabin and called for Clyde to come out. He opened the garage door so Houser could jot down the V-8 sedan's license number: Oklahoma 75-782. Clyde didn't think it was an immediate problem as he routinely switched plates on stolen cars. But it should have served as a warning sign that the staff at the Red Crown was especially vigilant. Clyde apparently didn't care. He told his family later that he liked the Red Crown cabins. They had stone and brick walls, which made him feel secure. If they needed to get to their car in a hurry, there was an interior door in Clyde's cabin that opened directly into the garage. Buck and Blanche's cabin didn't have one. They could only go in and out through the front door. </p><p> After dinner, everyone went to bed. They slept late on the morning of July 19. When Buck woke up, he told Blanche to go over to the other cabin and see when Clyde, Bonnie, and W.D. would be ready to leave. Clyde said he'd decided they would stay another day. He wanted Blanche to fetch some more food and beer. Clyde felt relaxed about their situation. The cabins were nice. Bonnie needed rest. So Clyde gave Blanche yet another pile of change. After she brought the food, he sent her out to pay Houser $4 for a second night's stay. Blanche wasn't exaggerating in her memoir when she complained about having to run all the gang's errands. Houser took the money and told Blanche she could have a refund if her group decided to leave before nightfall. She thought it was an odd remark, and told Clyde that Houser "was the type that might tell the law we were there if he had the slightest suspicion about us." He was, and he didn't have to go far to do it. </p><p> The Barrow Gang had no idea that the Red Crown Tavern served as a gathering place for local cops and the state highway patrol. Two-way radios were still nonexistent for most lawmen in the region, so officers and supervisors would often meet somewhere at mealtimes to exchange messages and receive orders. The Red Crown was a favorite spot because the food was so good. On July 19, Missouri Highway Patrol captain William Baxter and some of his men met there for lunch. Either Houser or one of his employees mentioned to Baxter that the people in the two tourist cabins were acting awfully strange. The woman checking them in said they were a party of three, but she was buying meals for five. Besides paying for everything in loose change and parking backward in the garage the way crooks often did, whoever was in the right-hand cabin had taped paper across the windows to block anybody looking in. Houser described them to Baxter, and also gave him the Ford's license number. Baxter made a note to check the plate, and meanwhile put the cabins under surveillance. </p><p> Someone also passed the word about suspicious characters at the Red Crown cabins to Platte County sheriff Holt Coffey. Coffey and Baxter got along well. When they conferred early in the afternoon of the 19th, they concluded it was possible that the four or five people (they weren't entirely sure whether it was three men and two women, or two and two) might be the notorious Barrow Gang. Bonnie Parker was known to be badly injured, and a farmer in Iowa had recently reported finding used bandages at a campsite in the country. That meant the Barrows were probably somewhere in the region -- why not Platte City? </p><p> The Barrows packed BARs, and Coffey worried that his own officers and the members of Baxter's highway patrol only had handguns and a few low-caliber rifles to return fire if it really was the gang and they tried to arrest them. Determined not to be outgunned, he went to see Sheriff Tom Bash, whose Jackson County department had jurisdiction for Kansas City and whose available armaments included machine guns, steel bulletproof shields, tear gas launchers, and armored cars. When Coffey drove over to ask for Bash's help, he didn't get the hoped-for offer of cooperation. As Coffey recalled it later, Bash snarled that he was "getting pretty damn tired of every hick sheriff in the country coming in here telling me they have a bunch of desperadoes holed up and wanting help." When Coffey insisted that they might be able to corner the infamous Barrow Gang, Bash finally agreed to send along a few officers and one armored car. This was an ordinary sedan whose sides had been reinforced with extra metal. </p><p> While Coffey pleaded with Bash, Lieutenant Baxter of the highway patrol got a report back on his license check. The number matched the plate on a Ford V-8 stolen on June 26 from a Dr. Fields in Enid, Oklahoma. Clyde, of course, had long since left that vehicle behind, but he foolishly kept the plate and screwed it on the bumper of the V8 he stole outside Fort Dodge on July 18. The Barrow Gang was suspected of the car theft in Enid, so Baxter felt he had more proof that Clyde and his cohorts were holed up in the Red Crown cabins. </p><p> By midafternoon, Baxter and Coffey began planning their raid. They knew Blanche had paid for the gang to stay a second night, so they decided to attack well after dark. The lawmen did their best to keep a low profile, but customers at the service station, grocery, and tavern all noticed highway patrolmen and county cops gathering and watching the tourist cabins. Word spread, and it soon seemed as though everyone but the Barrow Gang knew a confrontation was imminent. The newspaper Clyde had taped to his cabin windows to keep people from looking inside also prevented him from seeing what was going on outside. </p><p> At some point, either Clyde or Blanche walked to a local drugstore to buy bandages and over-the-counter medical supplies for Bonnie. Witnesses subsequently disagreed about who it was. Apparently, the lawmen let him or her come and go freely, not wanting to alert the rest of the gang and risk letting them escape. The druggist, who'd heard the rumors about criminals being in town, contacted Coffey to tell him about the purchases. The sheriff now felt certain that Bonnie Parker was in one of the Red Crown cabins. </p><p> That night in the left-hand cabin, Buck and Blanche talked about what they wanted to do next. Both were ready to leave Clyde, Bonnie, and W.D. They were tired of being bossed around. While Buck shined Blanche's boots, he suggested that they go north to Canada and find an isolated cabin to hide in. Buck thought they could make a living as trappers. Blanche said it would be fine with her -- anything to get away from the others. Then Blanche walked over to the grocery across the road to buy some soap. When she went inside, she noticed there were quite a few people there, and all of them stopped talking as soon as she entered. While Blanche waited for her purchases, she stepped on a scale and discovered she weighed ninety-one pounds, almost twenty less than she had back in March when Buck was released from prison. </p><p> Back in the cabin, Blanche told Buck the people in the store had acted strangely. He suggested that she go tell Clyde about it. Buck added that he thought they'd be fine if they didn't leave until the morning. Clyde told her the same thing. He sent Blanche back to the left-hand cabin, and a few minutes later W.D. followed to say Clyde wanted her to return to the grocery for sandwiches and beer. She refused, so W.D. went. After he got back -- apparently, W.D. didn't notice anything suspicious going on -- everyone had some food and then went to bed. </p><p> Around 1 a.m. on July 20, Baxter and Coffey gathered their men together. Counting themselves, the highway patrolmen, county cops, and two officers sent by Sheriff Bash of Jackson County in the armored car, the posse numbered thirteen. Coffey's nineteen-year-old son, Clarence, was one of the highway patrolmen, along with Leonard Ellis and Thomas Whitecotton. Whitecotton had rushed from the department office to be there. He was still wearing the fancy seersucker suit and Panama hat he favored for days spent behind a desk instead of out on patrol. Baxter and Coffey had machine guns. They also had thick metal shields that they carried in front of them like medieval knights. The shields were supposed to protect them from even high-caliber bullets. </p><p> Coffey and Baxter were in the lead as th...</p></p><h2>The Sun Dog</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Stephen King&#x2019;s novella <i>The Sun Dog</i>, published in his award-winning 1990 story collection <i>Four Past Midnight, </i>now available for the first time as a standalone publication.</b><br><br>The dog is loose again.

She had sent the first of these when Kevin was three, which meant he already had twelve unused string ties with horrible clasps in a drawer of his bureau, to which this would be added&#x2014;lucky thirteen. He had never worn any of them but was not allowed to throw them away. Aunt Hilda lived in Portland. She had never come to one of Kevin&#x2019;s or Meg&#x2019;s birthday parties, but she might decide to do just that one of these years. God knew she could; Portland was only fifty miles south of Castle Rock. And suppose she did come . . . and asked to see Kevin in one of his other ties (or Meg in one of her other scarves, for that matter)? With some relatives, an excuse might do. Aunt Hilda, however, was different. Aunt Hilda presented a certain golden possibility at a point where two essential facts about her crossed: she was Rich, and she was Old.<br> <br>Someday, Kevin&#x2019;s Mom was convinced, she might DO SOMETHING for Kevin and Meg. It was understood that the SOMETHING would probably come after Aunt Hilda finally kicked it, in the form of a clause in her will. In the meantime, it was thought wise to keep the horrible string ties and the equally horrible scarves. So this thirteenth string tie (on the clasp of which was a bird Kevin thought was a woodpecker) would join the others, and Kevin would write Aunt Hilda a thank-you note, not because his mother would insist on it and not because he thought or even cared that Aunt Hilda might DO SOMETHING for him and his kid sister someday, but because he was a generally thoughtful boy with good habits and no real vices.<br> <br>He thanked his family for all his gifts (his mother and father had, of course, supplied a number of lesser ones, although the Polaroid was clearly the centerpiece, and they were delighted with his delight), not forgetting to give Meg a kiss (she giggled and pretended to rub it off but her own delight was equally clear) and to tell her he was sure the mittens would come in handy on the ski team this winter&#x2014;but most of his attention was reserved for the Polaroid box, and the extra film packs which had come with it.<br> <br>He was a good sport about the birthday cake and the ice cream, although it was clear he was itching to get at the camera and try it out. And as soon as he decently could, he did.<br> <br>That was when the trouble started.<br> <br>He read the instruction booklet as thoroughly as his eagerness to begin would allow, then loaded the camera while the family watched with anticipation and unacknowledged dread (for some reason, the gifts which seem the most wanted are the ones which so often don&#x2019;t work). There was a little collective sigh&#x2014;more puff than gust&#x2014;when the camera obediently spat out the cardboard square on top of the film packet, just as the instruction booklet had promised it would.<br> <br>There were two small dots, one red and one green, separated by a zig-zag lightning-bolt on the housing of the camera. When Kevin loaded the camera, the red light came on. It stayed on for a couple of seconds. The family watched in silent fascination as the Sun 660 sniffed for light. Then the red light went out and the green light began to blink rapidly.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ready,&#x201d; Kevin said, in the same straining-to-be-off-hand-but-not-quite-making-it tone with which Neil Armstrong had reported his first step upon the surface of Luna. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t all you guys stand together?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate having my picture taken!&#x201d; Meg cried, covering her face with the theatrical anxiety and pleasure which only sub-teenage girls and really bad actresses can manage.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Meg,&#x201d; Mr. Delevan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a goose, Meg,&#x201d; Mrs. Delevan said.<br> <br>Meg dropped her hands (and her objections), and the three of them stood at the end of the table with the diminished birthday cake in the foreground.<br> <br>Kevin looked through the viewfinder. &#x201c;Squeeze a little closer to Meg, Mom,&#x201d; he said, motioning with his left hand. &#x201c;You too, Dad.&#x201d; This time he motioned with his right.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re squishing me!&#x201d; Meg said to her parents.<br> <br>Kevin put his finger on the button which would fire the camera, then remembered a briefly glimpsed note in the instructions about how easy it was to cut off your subjects&#x2019; heads in a photograph. Off with their heads, he thought, and it should have been funny, but for some reason he felt a little tingle at the base of his spine, gone and forgotten almost before it was noticed. He raised the camera a little. There. They were all in the frame. Good.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; he sang. &#x201c;Smile and say Intercourse!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kevin!&#x201d; his mother cried out.<br> <br>His father burst out laughing, and Meg screeched the sort of mad laughter not even bad actresses often essay; girls between the ages of ten and twelve own sole title to that particular laugh.<br> <br>Kevin pushed the button.<br> <br>The flashbulb, powered by the battery in the film pack, washed the room in a moment of righteous white light.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s mine, Kevin thought, and it should have been the surpassing moment of his fifteenth birthday. Instead, the thought brought back that odd little tingle. It was more noticeable this time.<br> <br>The camera made a noise, something between a squeal and a whirr, a sound just a little beyond description but familiar enough to most people, just the same: the sound of a Polaroid camera squirting out what may not be art but what is often serviceable and almost always provides instant gratification.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lemme see it!&#x201d; Meg cried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold your horses, muffin,&#x201d; Mr. Delevan said. &#x201c;They take a little time to develop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg was staring at the stiff gray surface of what was not yet a photograph with the rapt attention of a woman gazing into a crystal ball.<br> <br>The rest of the family gathered around, and there was that same feeling of anxiety which had attended the ceremony of Loading the Camera: still life of the American Family waiting to let out its breath.<br> <br>Kevin felt a terrible tenseness stealing into his muscles, and this time there was no question of ignoring it. He could not explain it . . . but it was there. He could not seem to take his eyes from that solid gray square within the white frame which would form the borders of the photograph.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I see me!&#x201d; Meg cried brightly. Then, a moment later: &#x201c;No. I guess I don&#x2019;t. I think I see&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>They watched in utter silence as the gray cleared, as the mists are reputed to do in a seer&#x2019;s crystal when the vibrations or feelings or whatever they are are right, and the picture became visible to them.<br> <br>Mr. Delevan was the first to break the silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; he asked no one in particular. &#x201c;Some kind of joke?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kevin had absently put the camera down rather too close to the edge of the table in order to watch the picture develop. Meg saw what the picture was and took a single step away. The expression on her face was neither fright nor awe but just ordinary surprise. One of her hands came up as she turned toward her father. The rising hand struck the camera and knocked it off the table and onto the floor. Mrs. Delevan had been looking at the emerging picture in a kind of trance, the expression on her face either that of a woman who is deeply puzzled or who is feeling the onset of a migraine headache. The sound of the camera hitting the floor startled her. She uttered a little scream and recoiled. In doing this, she tripped over Meg&#x2019;s foot and lost her balance. Mr. Delevan reached for her, propelling Meg, who was still between them, forward again, quite forcefully. Mr. Delevan not only caught his wife, but did so with some grace; for a moment they would have made a pretty picture indeed: Mom and Dad, showing they still know how to Cut A Rug, caught at the end of a spirited tango, she with one hand thrown up and her back deeply bowed, he bent over her in that ambiguous male posture which may be seen, when divorced from circumstance, as either solicitude or lust.<br> <br>Meg was eleven, and less graceful. She went flying back toward the table and smacked into it with her stomach. The hit was hard enough to have injured her, but for the last year and a half she had been taking ballet lessons at the YWCA three afternoons a week. She did not dance with much grace, but she enjoyed ballet, and the dancing had fortunately toughened the muscles of her stomach enough for them to absorb the blow as efficiently as good shock absorbers absorb the pounding a road full of potholes can administer to a car. Still, there was a band of black and blue just above her hips the next day. These bruises took almost two weeks to first purple, then yellow, then fade . . . like a Polaroid picture in reverse.<br> <br>At the moment this Rube Goldberg accident happened, she didn&#x2019;t even feel it; she simply banged into the table and cried out. The table tipped. The birthday cake, which should have been in the foreground of Kevin&#x2019;s first picture with his new camera, slid off the table. Mrs. Delevan didn&#x2019;t even have time to start her Meg, are you all right? before the remaining half of the cake fell on top of the Sun 660 with a juicy splat! that sent frosting all over their shoes and the baseboard of the wall.<br> <br>The viewfinder, heavily smeared with Dutch chocolate, peered out like a periscope. That was all.<br> <br>Happy birthday, Kevin.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Kevin and Mr. Delevan were sitting on the couch in the living room that evening when Mrs. Delevan came in, waving two dog-eared sheets of paper which had been stapled together. Kevin and Mr. Delevan both had open books in their laps (The Best and the Brightest for the father; Shoot-Out at Laredo for the son), but what they were mostly doing was staring at the Sun camera, which sat in disgrace on the coffee table amid a litter of Polaroid pictures. All the pictures appeared to show exactly the same thing.<br> <br>Meg was sitting on the floor in front of them, using the VCR to watch a rented movie. Kevin wasn&#x2019;t sure which one it was, but there were a lot of people running around and screaming, so he guessed it was a horror picture. Megan had a passion for them. Both parents considered this a low taste (Mr. Delevan in particular was often outraged by what he called &#x201c;that useless junk&#x201d;), but tonight neither of them had said a word. Kevin guessed they were just grateful she had quit complaining about her bruised stomach and wondering aloud what the exact symptoms of a ruptured spleen might be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here they are,&#x201d; Mrs. Delevan said. &#x201c;I found them at the bottom of my purse the second time through.&#x201d; She handed the papers&#x2014;a sales slip from J. C. Penney&#x2019;s and a MasterCard receipt&#x2014;to her husband. &#x201c;I can never find anything like this the first time. I don&#x2019;t think anyone can. It&#x2019;s like a law of nature.&#x201d;<br> <br>She surveyed her husband and son, hands on her hips.<br> <br>&#x201c;You two look like someone just killed the family cat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have a cat,&#x201d; Kevin said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you know what I mean. It&#x2019;s a shame, of course, but we&#x2019;ll get it sorted out in no time. Penney&#x2019;s will be happy to exchange it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not so sure of that,&#x201d; John Delevan said. He picked up the camera, looked at it with distaste (almost sneered at it, in fact), and then set it down again. &#x201c;It got chipped when it hit the floor. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Delevan took only a cursory glance. &#x201c;Well, if Penney&#x2019;s won&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m positive that the Polaroid company will. I mean, the fall obviously didn&#x2019;t cause whatever is wrong with it. The first picture looked just like all these, and Kevin took that one before Meg knocked it off the table.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to,&#x201d; Meg said without turning around. On the screen, a pint-sized figure&#x2014;a malevolent doll named Chucky, if Kevin had it right&#x2014;was chasing a small boy. Chucky was dressed in blue overalls and waving a knife.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, dear. How&#x2019;s your stomach?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurts,&#x201d; Meg said. &#x201c;A little ice cream might help. Is there any left over?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg gifted her mother with her most winning smile. &#x201c;Would you get some for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Mrs. Delevan said pleasantly. &#x201c;Get it yourself. And what&#x2019;s that horrible thing you&#x2019;re watching?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Child&#x2019;s Play,&#x201d; Megan said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s this doll named Chucky that comes to life. It&#x2019;s neat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Delevan wrinkled her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dolls don&#x2019;t come to life, Meg,&#x201d; her father said. He spoke heavily, as if knowing this was a lost cause.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chucky did,&#x201d; Meg said. &#x201c;In movies, anything can happen.&#x201d; She used the remote control to freeze the movie and went to get her ice cream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why does she want to watch that crap?&#x201d; Mr. Delevan asked his wife, almost plaintively.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, dear.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kevin had picked up the camera in one hand and several of the exposed Polaroids in the other&#x2014;they had taken almost a dozen in all. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not so sure I want a refund,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>His father stared at him. &#x201c;What? Jesus wept!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Kevin said, a little defensively, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying that maybe we ought to think about it. I mean, it&#x2019;s not exactly an ordinary defect, is it? I mean, if the pictures came out overexposed . . . or underexposed . . . or just plain blank . . . that would be one thing. But how do you get a thing like this? The same picture, over and over? I mean, look! And they&#x2019;re outdoors, even though we took every one of these pictures inside!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a practical joke,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;It must be. The thing to do is just exchange the damned thing and forget about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a practical joke,&#x201d; Kevin said. &#x201c;First, it&#x2019;s too complicated to be a practical joke. How do you rig a camera to take the same picture over and over? Plus, the psychology is all wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Psychology, yet,&#x201d; Mr. Delevan said, rolling his eyes at his wife.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, psychology!&#x201d; Kevin replied firmly. &#x201c;When a guy loads your cigarette or hands you a stick of pepper gum, he hangs around to watch the fun, doesn&#x2019;t he? But unless you or Mom have been pulling my leg&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father isn&#x2019;t much of a leg-puller, dear,&#x201d; Mrs. Delevan said, stating the obvious gently.<br> <br>Mr. Delevan was looking at Kevin with his lips pressed together. It was the look he always got when he perceived his son drifting toward that area of the ballpark where Kevin seemed most at home: left field. Far left field. There was a hunchy, intuitive streak in Kevin that had always puzzled and confounded him. He didn&#x2019;t know where it had come from, but he was sure it hadn&#x2019;t been his side of the family.<br> <br>He sighed and looked at the camera again. A piece of black plastic had been chipped from the left side of the housing, and there was a crack, surely no thicker than a human hair, down the center of the viewfinder lens. The crack was so thin it disappeared completely when you raised the camera to your eye to set the shot you would not get&#x2014;what you would get was on the coffee table, and there were nearly a dozen other examples in the dining room.<br> <br>What you got was something that looked like a refugee from the local animal shelter.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right, what i...</p><h2>Lost in the Library: A Story of Patience &amp; Fortitude (A New York Public Library Book)</h2><p><i>Lost in the Library: A Story of Patience &amp; Fortitude</i> is&nbsp;the&nbsp;first picture book about Patience and Fortitude, the two lion statues that faithfully guard the New York Public Library.

In the early 1950s, few African Americans could afford to buy cars, so this would be an adventure. But she soon found out that black travelers weren't treated very well in some towns. Many hotels and gas stations refused service to black people. Daddy was upset about something called Jim Crow laws . . .<br> <br> Finally, a friendly attendant at a gas station showed Ruth's family <em>The Green Book</em>.

He lives in Easton, Pennsylvania.</p><p>"An ever-expanding system of roads and highways beckoned to motorists in the mid-1900s, but the glamour of the open road was often illusory for African-American citizens, particularly those traversing the Jim Crow South. In this fictional account of a family trip, Ramsey introduces young listeners to the blatant discrimination facing those travelers, but more importantly, to the network of businesses and individuals who opened their doors with welcome assistance. The Negro Motorist Green Book, devised and expanded by Victor Green, was an invaluable aid, listing black-owned service stations, restaurants, and overnight accommodations. As narrator Ruth and her parents make their way from Chicago to her grandmother in Alabama, the girl becomes adept at using their seventy-five-cent resource and passes along information about the book to another beset traveler they meet at an inn. <strong>Cooper's soft, stippled illustrations capture both the pathos of the bigotry and the warmth of the support the family encounters, and a substantial closing note on the Green Book itself invites the audience to explore it further online. This will be a fascinating addition to any civil rights picture-book collection</strong> and perhaps even a quick intro to a classroom novel unit on <em>The Watsons Go to Birmingham&#x2015;1963</em> (BCCB 1/96)." --<em>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"At the core of this expressively illustrated fusion of fact and fiction is <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em>, first published in 1936, which listed hotels, restaurants, and other businesses that would serve African-Americans during an era when many would not. Charged with emotion, playwright Ramsey's story opens on an upbeat note, with Ruth and her parents embarking on a cross-country trip in their new 1952 Buick, traveling from Chicago to Grandma's home in Alabama. The family's spirits plummet when they are turned away from a service station restroom and a hotel, and see 'White Only' signs in restaurant windows ('It hurt my feelings to be so unwelcome,' says Ruth). However, a copy of the <em>Green Book</em> they purchase soon puts them in contact with friendly, helpful people all along the way. <strong>A sense of resiliency courses through Cooper's (<em>Back of the Bus</em>) filmy illustrations&#x2015;beatific portraits of the Esso worker who sells the family their<em> Green Book</em> and the owner of a 'tourist home' where the family spends the night radiate strength, kindness, and hope for a better future.</strong>" --<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In this powerful picture book, Atlanta playwright Ramsey tells a 1950s story from 'unknown pages in African American history.'<strong> Cooper's glowing, unframed, sepia-toned artwork delivers a strong sense of the period from a child's viewpoint.</strong> Driving with her parents from Chicago to Grandma's house in Alabama, Ruth is excited until the family is refused access to the restroom at a service station. They face more bitter realities of segregation when they sleep in the car because they are turned away from hotels. The double-page spreads show the hurt, anger, and scariness of the 'No Vacancy' signs, but words and images also capture moments of peace, as Ruth sings and feels safe with her loving parents as they drive across the country. Then they are welcomed at an Esso station, where they get a copy of the pamphlet called <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em>, which lists places where black people are welcome. A joyful reunion with Grandma brings the book to a warm close. With a long final note about <em>The Green Book</em>, <strong>this is a compelling addition to U.S. history offerings.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In the early 1950s, newly built interstate highways invited Americans to travel by automobile, but the open road wasn't so open for African-Americans, especially in the South. Ramsey drives this truth home in this story of the journey of a family traveling from Chicago to Alabama by car. 'It was a BIG day at our house when Daddy drove up in our very own automobile&#x2015;a 1952 Buick!...I was so excited to travel across the country!' Ruth's family encounters many of the obstacles that existed, from whites-only restrooms in gas stations to whites-only hotels: 'It seemed like there were "White Only" signs everywhere outside of our Chicago neighborhood.' <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em> comes to the rescue, listing resources for black motorists in every state, and Ruth and her family make their way from safe haven to safe haven until they reach Alabama. <strong>Cooper masterfully captures the emotions of the characters, filling his pages with three-dimensional individuals. This story touches on a little-known moment in American history with elegance, compassion and humanity.</strong>" --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Ruth is excited to be driving with her parents from Chicago to Alabama in their 'very own automobile&#x2015;a 1952 Buick!' The trip starts out well, but the family continually runs up against segregation until they learn about The Negro Motorist Green Book, a pamphlet 'to help black people who were traveling.' <strong>Ramsey fashions a well-told historical narrative, supported by Cooper's expressive paintings</strong>." --<em>The Horn Book Guide</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Ruth's father just bought a beautiful new 1952 Buick, making it a big day for this African-American family. They are going from Chicago to Alabama to visit Grandma. Ruth is very excited to be traveling, but the family encounters 'whites only' restrooms, hotels, and restaurants along the way. It's very discouraging and sometimes scary, but they learn that some friendly faces may be found at local Esso stations, which are among the few franchises open to black businessmen. At a station near the Georgia border, they are introduced to Victor H. Green's The Negro Motorist Green Book, an early AAA guidebook of sorts that listed establishments or homes that would serve African Americans&#x2013;be it for general services, housing, or meals. Ruth eventually becomes the Green Book specialist in the family, helping to guide them to an auto-repair shop or an inn that would welcome them. But, the best part of the trip is finally arriving at Grandma's, as illustrated by the loving expressions on all faces. A one-page concluding summary discusses the importance of The Green Book, which was in use from 1936-1964, when the Civil Rights Act was finally signed, banning racial discrimination. <strong>The realistic illustrations are done in oil wash on board, a self-described 'subtractive process.' The picture is painted, then erased to 'paint' the final product. Overall, there is a sepialike quality to the art, giving the impression of gazing at old color photos. This is an important addition to picture book collections, useful as a discussion-starter on Civil Rights or as a stand-alone story.</strong>" --<em>School Library Journal</em><br></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Norway (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>The ideal travel companion, full of insider advice on what to see and do, plus detailed itineraries and comprehensive maps for exploring this cultured and vibrant nation.</b><br><br>Explore Oslo's excellent museums and enjoy the lively waterfront area, tour Norway's spectacular fjords, delight in a remarkable train journey on the steeply winding Fl�msbanen line, visit stave churches in Lom, Gudbrandsdalen, and L�rdal, and see the Northern Lights: everything you need to know is clearly laid out within color-coded chapters.

As united by their opposition as they are divided by their goals, the members of the New Right are willfully suspicious of those in the mainstream who would seek to tell their story. Fortunately, author Michael Malice was there from the very inception, and in <i>The New Right</i> recounts their tale from the beginning.</p><p>Malice provides an authoritative and unbiased portrait of the New Right as a movement of ideas&#x2015;ideas that he traces to surprisingly diverse ideological roots. From the heterodox right wing of the 1940s to the Buchanan/Rothbard alliance of 1992 and all the way through to what he witnessed personally in Charlottesville, <i>The New Right</i> is a thorough firsthand accounting of the concepts, characters and chronology of this widely misunderstood sociopolitical phenomenon.</p><p>Today&#x2019;s fringe is tomorrow&#x2019;s orthodoxy. As entertaining as it is informative, <i>The New Right</i> is required reading for every American across the spectrum who would like to learn more about the past, present and future of our divided political culture.</p></p><p>MICHAEL MALICE is the author of <i>Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il </i>and the subject of Harvey Pekar&#x2019;s graphic novel <i>Ego &amp; Hubris</i>.

It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers&#39; questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.</p><p>Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation.

Spanning Pasadena to Paris, acclaimed author Bob Spitz reveals the history behind the woman who taught America how to cook. <br><br> A genuine rebel who took the pretensions that embellished French cuisine and fricasseed them to a fare-thee-well, paving the way for a new era of American food&#x2014;not to mention blazing a new trail in television&#x2014;Child redefined herself in middle age, fought for women&#x2019;s rights, and forever altered how we think about what we eat. <br><br> Chronicling Julia's struggles, her heartwarming romance with Paul, and, of course, the publication of <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> and her triumphant TV career, <i>Dearie</i> is an extraordinarily entertaining account of a truly remarkable life.</p><p><p><b> Featured Essay: Author Bob Spitz on <em>Dearie</em></b></p> <p> Because Julia Child is such a familiar and beloved presence in our culture, it is amazing how much there was left to learn about her. <em>Julie and Julia</em>, along with Julia's lovely memoir <em>My Life in France</em> only scratched the surface of this remarkable and fascinating woman who actually launched PBS (really!) and defined the American palate. For much of her adolescence and throughout her twenties, Julia was something of a lost soul. She burned with a desire to have an impact on the world but had no idea how to make that happen or what field she might excel in. It disappointed her that she was nothing more than what she called "a social butterfly," without a goal. "I felt I had particular and unique gifts," she wrote in her diary, "that I was meant for something, and was like no one else." How right she was! But she weathered many misadventures before those gifts began to materialize.</p> <p> Oddly, everything began to coalesce for Julia in Ceylon, of all places. At the outbreak of World War II, still without a sense of purpose, she volunteered for government service and was shipped overseas as a member of the OSS, America's burgeoning spy agency that later became the CIA. She worked in its Registry, under "Wild Bill" Donovan, and was responsible for the location and movements of every U.S. spy operating in the Southeast Asia theater.</p> <p> In Ceylon, Julia also met her future husband, Paul Child, who worked in a capacity similar to hers. Initially, Julia had had a hard time finding true love--it took her awhile. Back home, the heir to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> had proposed to her on several occasions, but he struck Julia as too bland for her outsized spirit. She was a big person (over 6'3") with a big personality and couldn't be contained in the expected role of "the little woman." I found it very moving when she finally found true love, although she was still adrift about what her life purpose would be.</p> <p> A lunch in France changed everything. It was a powerful moment when she hit on her true calling at the age of forty. In the book, I delve into the extraordinary path Julia followed to create eye-poppingly delicious food and introduce it to an American public that was starving for a new, imaginative and creative way to cook. From there, it was through engaging force of her once-troublesome outsized personality that she went on to have a profound impact on the way people eat--and live.</p><b>Bob Spitz</b> is the award-winning author of <i>The Beatles, </i>a <i>New York Times </i>best seller, <i>Reagan</i>,&nbsp;as well as seven other nonfiction<i> </i>books and a screenplay.

We pursue knowledge the way a pig pursues truffles.</i></p><p> &#x2014;DAVID OGILVY</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>AN INTRODUCTION TO GROWTH HACKING</p><p>Nearly two years ago now, on what seemed like a normal day, I got in my car to leave my house, assuming it would be no different from any other workday. I had read the morning news, dealt with a few important employee issues over the phone, and confirmed lunch and drinks meetings for later in the day. I headed to the athletic club&#x2014;a swanky, century-old private gym favored by downtown executives&#x2014;and swam and ran and then sat in the steam room to think.</p><p>As I entered the office around ten, I nodded to my assistant and sat down at a big desk and reviewed all the papers that required my signature. There were ad designs to approve, invoices to process, events to sponsor, proposals to review. A new product was launching, and I had a press release to write. A stack of magazines had arrived&#x2014;I handed them to an employee to catalog and organize for the press library.</p><p>My job: director of marketing at American Apparel. I had a half dozen employees working under me in my office. Right across the hall from us, thousands of sewing machines were humming away, manned by the world&#x2019;s most efficient garment workers. A few doors down was a photo studio where the very ads I would be placing were made.</p><p>Excepting the help of a few pieces of technology, like my computer and smartphone, my day had begun and would proceed exactly as it had for every other marketing executive for the last seventy-five years. Buy advertisements, plan events, pitch reporters, design &#x201c;creatives,&#x201d; approve promotions, and throw around terms like &#x201c;brand,&#x201d; &#x201c;CPM,&#x201d; &#x201c;awareness,&#x201d; &#x201c;earned media,&#x201d; &#x201c;top of mind,&#x201d; &#x201c;added value,&#x201d; and &#x201c;share of voice.&#x201d; That was the job; that&#x2019;s always been the job.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m Don Draper or Edward Bernays or anything, but the three of us could probably have swapped offices and routines with only a few adjustments. And I, along with everyone else in the business, found that to be pretty damn cool.</p><p>But that seemingly ordinary day was disrupted by an article. The headline stood out clearly amid the online noise, as though it had been lobbed directly at me: &#x201c;Growth Hacker Is the New VP [of] Marketing.&#x201d;</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>I was a VP of marketing. I quite liked my job. I was good at it, too. Self-taught, self-made, I was, at twenty-five, helping to lead the efforts of a publicly traded company with 250 stores in twenty countries and more than $600 million in revenue.</p><p>But the writer, Andrew Chen, an influential technologist and entrepreneur, didn&#x2019;t care about any of that. According to him, my colleagues and I would soon be out of a job&#x2014;someone was waiting in the wings to replace us.</p><p><i>The new job title of &#x201c;Growth Hacker&#x201d; is integrating itself into Silicon Valley&#x2019;s culture, emphasizing that coding and technical chops are now an essential part of being a great marketer. Growth hackers are a hybrid of marketer and coder, one who looks at the traditional question of &#x201c;How do I get customers for my product?&#x201d; and answers with A/B tests, landing pages, viral factor, email deliverability, and Open Graph.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p><i>The entire marketing team is being disrupted.

And now, their shortcuts, innovations, and backdoor solutions fly in the face of everything we&#x2019;ve been taught.</p><p>We all want to do more with less. For marketers and entrepreneurs, that paradox is practically our job description. Well, in this book, we&#x2019;re going to look at how growth hackers have helped companies like Dropbox, Mailbox, Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, Snapchat, Evernote, Instagram, Mint.com, AppSumo, and StumbleUpon do so much with essentially nothing.</p><p>What stunned me most about those companies was that none of them were built with any of the skills that traditional marketers like myself had always considered special, and most were built without the resources I&#x2019;d long considered essential. I couldn&#x2019;t name the &#x201c;marketer&#x201d;&#x2014;and definitely not the agency&#x2014;responsible for their success because there wasn&#x2019;t one. Growth hacking had made &#x201c;marketing&#x201d; irrelevant, or at the very least it had completely rewritten its best practices.</p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re currently a marketing executive or a college grad about to enter the field&#x2014;the first growth hackers have pioneered a new way. Some of their strategies are incredibly technical and complex. The strategies also change constantly; in fact, occasionally it might work only one time. This book is short because it sticks with the timeless parts. I also won&#x2019;t weigh you down with heavy concepts like &#x201c;cohort analysis&#x201d; and &#x201c;viral coefficients.&#x201d;* Instead, we will focus on the mindset&#x2014;it&#x2019;s far and away the most important part.</p><p>I start and end with my own experiences in this book, not because I am anyone special but because I think they illustrate a microcosm of the industry itself. The old way&#x2014;where product development and marketing were two distinct and separate processes&#x2014;has been replaced. We all find ourselves in the same position: needing to do more with less and finding, increasingly, that the old strategies no longer generate results.</p><p>So in this book, I am going to take you through a new cycle, a much more fluid and iterative process. A growth hacker doesn&#x2019;t see marketing as something one does but rather as something one builds into the product itself. The product is then kick-started, shared, and optimized (with these steps repeated multiple times) on its way to massive and rapid growth. The chapters of this book follow that structure.</p><p></p></p><h2>Jingo: A Novel of Discworld (Discworld, 21)</h2><p><p>It isn't much of an island that rises up one moonless night from the depths of the Circle Sea&#x2014;just a few square miles of silt and some old ruins. Unfortunately, the historically disputed lump of land called Leshp is once again floating directly between Ankh-Morpork and the city of Al-Khali on the coast of Klatch&#x2014;which is spark enough to ignite that glorious international pastime called "war." Pressed into patriotic service, Commander Sam Vimes thinks he should be leading his loyal watchmen, female watchdwarf, and lady werewolf into battle against local malefactors rather than against uncomfortably well-armed strangers in the Klatchian desert. But war is, after all, simply the greatest of all crimes&#x2014;and it's Sir Samuel's sworn duty to seek out criminal masterminds wherever they may be hiding and lock them away before they can do any real damage . . . even the ones on his side.</p></p><p>Terry Pratchett is a phenomenon unto himself. Never read a Discworld book? The closest comparison might be <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, with its uniquely British sense of the absurd, and side-splitting, smart humor. <i>Jingo</i> is the 20th of Pratchett's Discworld novels, and the fourth to feature the City Guard of Ankh-Morpork. As <i>Jingo</i> begins, an island suddenly rises between Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali, capital of Klatch. Both cities claim it. Lord Vetinari, the Patrician, has failed to convince the Ruling Council that force is a bad idea, despite reminding them that they have no army, and "I believe one of those is generally considered vital to the successful prosecution of a war." Samuel Vimes, Commander of the City Watch, has to find out who shot the Klatchian envoy, Prince Khufurah, and set fire to their embassy, before war breaks out. <p> Pratchett's characters are both sympathetic and outrageously entertaining, from Captain Carrot, who always finds the best in people and puts it to work playing football, to Sergeant Colon and his sidekick, Corporal Nobbs, who have "an ability to get out of their depth on a wet pavement." Then there is the mysterious D'reg, 71-hour Ahmed. What is his part in all this, and why 71 hours? Anyone who doesn't mind laughing themselves silly at the idiocy of people in general and governments in particular will enjoy <i>Jingo</i>. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Something new has come up between the Discworld&#39;s ancient rival cities of Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali. Literally. It&#39;s an island, rising out of Discworld&#39;s sea, uninhabited and claimed by both cities. Ankh-Morpork has been at peace for a century, and so has Al-Khali. But now there are people on both sides who think it&#39;s time to give war a chance, and will happily help it on its way with a few murders... Modern war needs modern weapons. Unfortunately, Ankh-Morpork got rich making and selling them to Al-Khali. But it&#39;s just possible that salvation lies in the hands of the great inventive genius Leonard of Quirm, whose sketchbooks are filled with devices for killing people, flying through the air, and weighing cheese.</p><h2>Chicken Soup for the Soul: Random Acts of Kindness: 101 Stories of Compassion and Paying It Forward</h2><p>Small gestures can make a big difference in someone&#x2019;s day, even someone&#x2019;s life.

Then service gets to make a brief appearance for as long as it takes to calm the customer down and fix whatever foul-up jeopardized the relationship.<br><br>In <i>Uncommon Service</i>, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss show how, in a volatile economy where the old rules of strategic advantage no longer hold true, service must become a competitive weapon, not a damage-control function. That means weaving service tightly into every core decision your company makes.<br><br>The authors reveal a transformed view of service, presenting an operating model built on tough choices organizations must make:<br><br> <b>How do customers define excellence&#x201d; in your offering?</b> Is it convenience? Friendliness? Flexible choices? Price?<br><br> <b>How will you get paid for that excellence?</b> Will you charge customers more? Get them to handle more service tasks themselves?<br><br> <b>How will you empower your employees to deliver excellence?</b> What will your recruiting, selection, training, and job design practices look like? What about your organizational culture?<br><br> <b>How will you get your customers to behave?</b> For example, what do you need to do to get them to treat your employees with respect? Do you need to make it easier for them to use new technology?<br><br>Practical and engaging, <i>Uncommon Service</i> makes a powerful case for a new and systematic approach to service as a means of boosting productivity, profitability, and competitive advantage.</p><p><b>Frances Frei</b> is UPS Foundation Professor of Service Management at Harvard Business School, where she developed the school&#x2019;s successful Managing Service Operations course. <b>Anne Morriss</b> is the Managing Director of the Concire Leadership Institute, a consulting firm that helps leaders to surface and remove performance barriers.The book was uncommonly excellent. Very straightforward and to the point. Frei and Morriss uncover four basic truths about customer service, discuss the important ingredient of culture and provide guidance on how companies can scale to get bigger...this might be the best book I&#x2019;ve ever read on achieving service excellence.&#x201d; <b>Stan Phelps, CustomerThink (customerthink.com)</b><br><br> This book is a practical guide for leaders who want to use service to strategically differentiate their companies from the competition.&#x201d; <b>Jeff Toister, CustomerThink (customerthink.com)</b><br><br> Anne Morriss and Harvard Business School Professor Frances Frei make the counterintuitive, but compelling argument that true success for service businesses requires that you give up on being perfect; that you make some tradeoffs.&#x201d; <b>Business Insider (businessinsider.com)</b><br><br> Morriss and Frei have a powerful and surprising answer &#x201d; <b>Forbes.com</b><br><br> In this upbeat and highly readable book, the authors isolate four service truths&#x201d; that companies must understand &#x201d; <b><i>BizEd</i> magazine</b><br><br> The book is full of case studies showing how companies have harnessed their strengths but cut corners elsewhere, in pursuit of the ultimate goal: excellent service.&#x201d; <b><i>South Africa Financial Mail</i></b><br><br> I found <i>Uncommon Service</i> to be a refreshing, frank and honest look at how any organization can increase profitability, satisfaction and competitive advantage by delivering consistently outstanding service.&#x201d; <b>American Express Open Forum</b><br></p><h2>The Puppy Place #3: Shadow</h2><p>Welcome to the Puppy Place--where every puppy finds a home!<br><br> Charles and Lizzie Peterson know a lot about puppies.&nbsp; That's because the Petersons are a foster family for young dogs.

A former staff editor at the Smithsonian Institution, she currently writes and produces books for both adults and children.<b>FULLY UPDATED TO 2017<br><br>A NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER</b><br><b><br>SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL<br><br></b>While many adults know Richard Nixon&#x2019;s nickname (&#x201c;Tricky Dick&#x201d;) and the toy named after Theodore Roosevelt (the teddy bear), here students are offered much more, from the mundane (which president had the largest shoe size) to the more important (how many presidents have died while serving in office). With well-organized chapter headings (&#x201c;Assassination, Death and National Mourning,&#x201d; &#x201c;Stumping,&#x201d; &#x201c;Home, Hotel, Parlor and Playground&#x201d;), there are few aspects of the presidency overlooked&#x2013;from illegitimate children and other controversies to spouses, pets, and even Facebook campaigns. A smattering of black-and-white photos lends accuracy and interest, allowing history buffs a peek at some of the Smithsonian&#x2019;s presidential artifacts, including campaign buttons, clothing, medallions, and paper ephemera. While the institution is a reputable source of information, there are a few subtleties that could be debated in some of the answers listed. For example, one question asks, &#x201c;Which president was accused of fathering an illegitimate child?&#x201d; The answer listed is Grover Cleveland, and while it is is true that he has been accused, Thomas Jefferson has been too (although those indiscretions have been verified).

There are behavioral realities that exist between black men and black women that are deadly, and sometimes irreversible, that impede and preclude establishing loving unions.

I had decided, as I&#x2019;d driven over to her house, my iPod off and my hands gripping the steering wheel, that if she was there, I wouldn&#x2019;t even need an explanation. It wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary for her to tell me why she&#x2019;d suddenly stopped answering her phone, texts, and e-mails, or why she&#x2019;d vanished, along with her parents and their car. I knew it was ridiculous to think this way, like I was negotiating with some cosmic dealer who could guarantee this for me, but that didn&#x2019;t stop me as I got closer and closer to Randolph Farms Lane. I didn&#x2019;t care what I had to promise if it meant Sloane would be there. Because if Sloane was there, everything could start making sense again.<br> <br>It was not an exaggeration to say that the last two weeks had been the worst of my life. The first weekend after school had ended, I&#x2019;d been dragged upstate by my parents against my wishes and despite my protests. When I&#x2019;d come back to Stanwich, after far too many antique shops and art galleries, I&#x2019;d called her immediately, car keys in my hand, waiting impatiently for her to answer so that she could tell me where she was, or, if she was home, that I could pick her up. But Sloane didn&#x2019;t answer her phone, and she didn&#x2019;t answer when I called back an hour later, or later that night, or before I went to bed.<br> <br>The next day, I drove by her house, only to see her parents&#x2019; car gone and the windows dark. She wasn&#x2019;t responding to texts and still wasn&#x2019;t answering her phone. It was going right to voice mail, but I wasn&#x2019;t worried, not then. Sloane would sometimes let her battery run down until the phone shut off, and she never seemed to know where her charger was. And her parents, Milly and Anderson, had a habit of forgetting to tell her their travel plans. They would whisk her off to places like Palm Beach or Nantucket, and Sloane would return a few days later, tan, with a present for me and stories to tell. I was sure that&#x2019;s what had happened this time.<br> <br>But after three days, and still no word, I worried. After five days, I panicked. When I couldn&#x2019;t stand being in my house any longer, staring down at my phone, willing it to ring, I&#x2019;d started driving around town, going to all of our places, always able to imagine her there until the moment I arrived to find it Sloane-free. She wasn&#x2019;t stretched out in the sun on a picnic table at the Orchard, or flipping through the sale rack at Twice Upon a Time, or finishing up her pineapple slice at Captain Pizza. She was just gone.<br> <br>I had no idea what to do with myself. It was rare for us not to see each other on a daily basis, and we talked or texted constantly, with nothing off-limits or too trivial, even exchanges like I think my new skirt make me look like I&#x2019;m Amish, promise to tell me if it does? (me) and Have you noticed it&#x2019;s been a while since anyone&#x2019;s seen the Loch Ness monster? (her). In the two years we&#x2019;d been best friends, I had shared almost all of my thoughts and experiences with her, and the sudden silence felt deafening. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do except to continue texting and trying to find her. I kept reaching for my phone to tell Sloane that I was having trouble handling the fact she wasn&#x2019;t answering her phone.<br> <br>I drew in a breath and I held it as I pulled down her driveway, the way I used to when I was little and opening up my last birthday present, willing it to be the one thing I still didn&#x2019;t have, the only thing I wanted.<br> <br>But the driveway was empty, and all the windows were dark. I pulled up in front of the house anyway, then put my car in park and killed the engine. I slumped back against the seat, fighting to keep down the lump that was rising in my throat. I no longer knew what else to do, where else to look. But Sloane couldn&#x2019;t be gone. She wouldn&#x2019;t have left without telling me.<br> <br>But then where was she?<br> <br>When I felt myself on the verge of tears, I got out of the car and squinted at the house in the morning sun. The fact that it was empty, this early, was really all the evidence I needed, since I had never known Milly or Anderson to be awake before ten. Even though I knew there was probably no point to it, I crossed to the house and walked up the wide stone steps that were covered with bright green summer leaves. The leaves were thick enough that I had to kick them aside, and I knew, deep down, that it was more proof that nobody was there, and hadn&#x2019;t been there for a while now. But I walked toward the front door, with its brass lion&#x2019;s-head knocker, and knocked anyway, just like I&#x2019;d done five other times that week. I waited, trying to peer in the glass on the side of the door, still with a tiny flicker of hope that in a second, any minute now, I&#x2019;d hear Sloane&#x2019;s steps as she ran down the hall and threw open the door, yanking me into a hug, already talking a mile a minute. But the house was silent, and all I could see through the glass was the historical-status plaque just inside the door, the one that proclaimed the house &#x201c;one of Stanwich&#x2019;s architectural treasures,&#x201d; the one that always seemed covered with ghosts of fingerprints.<br> <br>I waited another few minutes, just in case, then turned around and lowered myself to sit on the top step, trying very hard not to have a breakdown among the leaves.<br> <br>There was a piece of me that was still hoping to find this had been a very realistic nightmare, and that any minute now, I&#x2019;d wake up, and Sloane would be there, on the other end of her phone like she was supposed to be, already planning out the day for us.<br> <br>Sloane&#x2019;s house was in what was always called &#x201c;backcountry,&#x201d; where the houses got larger and farther apart from each other, on ever-bigger pieces of land. She was ten miles away from my place, which, back when I&#x2019;d been in peak running shape, had been easy for me to cross. But even though they were close, our neighborhoods couldn&#x2019;t have been more different. Here, there was only the occasional car driving past, and the silence seemed to underscore the fact that I was totally alone, that there was nobody home and, most likely, nobody coming back. I leaned forward, letting my hair fall around me like a curtain. If nobody was there, it at least meant I could stay awhile, and I wouldn&#x2019;t be asked to leave. I could probably stay there all day. I honestly didn&#x2019;t know what else to do with myself.<br> <br>I heard the low rumble of an engine and looked up, fast, pushing my hair out of my face, feeling hope flare once more in my chest. But the car rolling slowly down the driveway wasn&#x2019;t Anderson&#x2019;s slightly dented BMW. It was a yellow pickup truck, the back piled with lawnmowers and rakes. When it pulled in front of the steps, I could see the writing, in stylized cursive, on the side. Stanwich Landscaping, it read. Planting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gardening&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maintenance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and mulch, mulch more! Sloane loved when stores had cheesy names or slogans. Not that she was a huge fan of puns, but she&#x2019;d always said she liked to picture the owners thinking them up, and how pleased with themselves they must have been when they landed on whatever they&#x2019;d chosen. I immediately made a mental note to tell Sloane about the motto, and then, a moment later, realized how stupid this was.<br> <br>Three guys got out of the truck and headed for the back of it, two of them starting to lift down the equipment. They looked older, like maybe they were in college, and I stayed frozen on the steps, watching them. I knew that this was an opportunity to try and get some information, but that would involve talking to these guys. I&#x2019;d been shy from birth, but the last two years had been different. With Sloane by my side, it was like I suddenly had a safety net. She was always able to take the lead if I wanted her to, and if I didn&#x2019;t, I knew she would be there, jumping in if I lost my nerve or got flustered. And when I was on my own, awkward or failed interactions just didn&#x2019;t seem to matter as much, since I knew I&#x2019;d be able to spin it into a story, and we could laugh about it afterward. Without her here, though, it was becoming clear to me how terrible I now was at navigating things like this on my own.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; I jumped, realizing I was being addressed by one of the landscapers. He was looking up at me, shielding his eyes against the sun as the other two hefted down a riding mower. &#x201c;You live here?&#x201d;<br> <br>The other two guys set the mower down, and I realized I knew one of them; he&#x2019;d been in my English class last year, making this suddenly even worse. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, and heard how scratchy my voice sounded. I had been saying only the most perfunctory things to my parents and younger brother over the last two weeks, and the only talking I&#x2019;d really been doing had been into Sloane&#x2019;s voice mail. I cleared my throat and tried again. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>The guy who&#x2019;d spoken to me raised his eyebrows, and I knew this was my cue to go. I was, at least in their minds, trespassing, and would probably get in the way of their work. All three guys were now staring at me, clearly just waiting for me to leave. But if I left Sloane&#x2019;s house&#x2014;if I ceded it to these strangers in yellow T-shirts&#x2014;where was I going to get more information? Did that mean I was just accepting the fact that she was gone?<br> <br>The guy who&#x2019;d spoken to me folded his arms across his chest, looking impatient, and I knew I couldn&#x2019;t keep sitting there. If Sloane had been with me, I would have been able to ask them. If she were here, she probably would have gotten two of their numbers already and would be angling for a turn on the riding mower, asking if she could mow her name into the grass. But if Sloane were here, none of this would be happening in the first place. My cheeks burned as I pushed myself to my feet and walked quickly down the stone steps, my flip-flops sliding once on the leaves, but I steadied myself before I wiped out and made this more humiliating than it already was. I nodded at the guys, then looked down at the driveway as I walked over to my car.<br> <br>Now that I was leaving, they all moved into action, distributing equipment and arguing about who was doing what. I gripped my door handle, but didn&#x2019;t open it yet. Was I really just going to go? Without even trying?<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; I said, but not loudly enough, as the guys continued to talk to each other, none of them looking over at me, two of them having an argument about whose turn it was to fertilize, while the guy from last year&#x2019;s English class held his baseball cap in his hands, bending the bill into a curve. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; I said, but much too loudly this time, and the guys stopped talking and looked over at me again. I could feel my palms sweating, but I knew I had to keep going, that I wouldn&#x2019;t be able forgive myself if I just turned around and left. &#x201c;I was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I let out a shaky breath. &#x201c;My friend lives here, and I was trying to find her. Do you&#x2014;&#x201d; I suddenly saw, like I was observing the scene on TV, how ridiculous this probably was, asking the landscaping guys for information on my best friend&#x2019;s whereabouts. &#x201c;I mean, did they hire you for this job? Her parents, I mean? Milly or Anderson Williams?&#x201d; Even though I was trying not to, I could feel myself grabbing on to this possibility, turning it into something I could understand. If the Williamses had hired Stanwich Landscaping, maybe they were just on a trip somewhere, getting the yard stuff taken care of while they were gone so they wouldn&#x2019;t be bothered. It was just a long trip, and they had gone somewhere with no cell reception or e-mail service. That was all.<br> <br>The guys looked at each other, and it didn&#x2019;t seem like any of these names had rung a bell. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; said the guy who&#x2019;d first spoken to me. &#x201c;We just get the address. We don&#x2019;t know about that stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded, feeling like I&#x2019;d just depleted my last reserve of hope. Thinking about it, the fact that landscapers were here was actually a bit ominous, as I had never once seen Anderson show the slightest interest in the lawn, despite the fact that the Stanwich Historical Society was apparently always bothering him to hire someone to keep up the property.<br> <br>Two of the guys had headed off around the side of the house, and the guy from my English class looked at me as he put on his baseball cap. &#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;re friends with Sloane Williams, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said immediately. This was my identity at school, but I&#x2019;d never minded it&#x2014;and now, I&#x2019;d never been so happy to be recognized that way. Maybe he knew something, or had heard something. &#x201c;Sloane&#x2019;s actually who I&#x2019;m looking for. This is her house, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>The guy nodded, then gave me an apologetic shrug. &#x201c;Sorry I don&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hope you find her.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t ask me what my name was, and I didn&#x2019;t volunteer it. What would be the point?<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I managed to say, but a moment too late, as he&#x2019;d already joined the other two. I looked at the house once more, the house that somehow no longer even felt like Sloane&#x2019;s, and realized that there was nothing left to do except leave.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t head right home; instead I stopped in to Stanwich Coffee, on the very off chance that there would be a girl in the corner chair, her hair in a messy bun held up with a pencil, reading a British novel that used dashes instead of quotation marks. But Sloane wasn&#x2019;t there. And as I headed back to my car I realized that if she had been in town, it would have been unthinkable that she wouldn&#x2019;t have called me back. It had been two weeks; something was wrong.<br> <br>Strangely, this thought buoyed me as I headed for home. When I left the house every morning, I just let my parents assume that I was meeting up with Sloane, and if they asked what my plans were, I said vague things about applying for jobs. But I knew now was the moment to tell them that I was worried; that I needed to know what had happened. After all, maybe they knew something, even though my parents weren&#x2019;t close with hers. The first time they&#x2019;d met, Milly and Anderson had come to collect Sloane from a sleepover at my house, two hours later than they&#x2019;d been supposed to show up. And after pleasantries had been exchanged and Sloane and I had said good-bye, my dad had shut the door, turned to my mother, and groaned, &#x201c;That was like being stuck in a Gurney play.&#x201d; I hadn&#x2019;t known what he&#x2019;d meant by this, but I could tell by his tone of voice that it hadn&#x2019;t been a compliment. But even though they hadn&#x2019;t been friends, they still might know something. Or they might be able to find something out.<br> <br>I held on to this thought tighter and tighter as I got closer to my house. We lived close to one of the four commercial districts scattered throughout Stanwich. My neighborhood was pedestrian-friendly and walkable, and there was always lots of traffic, both cars and people, usually heading in the direction of the beach, a ten-minute drive from our house. Stanwich, Connecticut, was on Long Island Sound, and though there were no waves, there was still sand and beautiful views and stunning houses that had the water as their backyards.<br> <br>Our house, in contrast, was an old Victorian that my parents had been fixing up ever since we&#x2019;d moved in six years earlier...</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Castle: Discover the Mysteries of the Medieval Castle and See What Life Was Like for Tho</h2><p>Be an eyewitness to the exciting world of the medieval castle, from the dramatic methods used to defend and attack castles to what life was really like for the people living inside its mighty battlements.</p><p>hotos.

And the second thing is: &#x201c;What will happen to my children?&#x201d;</b></i><br><b>BALANCING YOUR NEEDS AND YOUR CHILDREN&#x2019;S NEEDS</b>Here are two things that happened in our program at the Cleveland Clinic:A young mother was being treated for cancer. She and her husband decided not to tell their nine-year-old son any details&#x2014;too disturbing; why worry the boy? We&#x2019;ll just say Mom is sick; she&#x2019;ll be better soon.But then the child began &#x201c;acting out&#x201d; in school&#x2014;fighting with playmates, disrupting classes, falling behind. So the parents brought him to our program.When I met him, the boy was grumpy&#x2014;angry with his family, annoyed at being haled before a child life counselor. Yet behind all that he wanted to talk, and very soon he did talk.He&#x2019;d overheard his father on the telephone, speaking gravely with a relative. He&#x2019;d heard the words &#x201c;malignant melanoma&#x201d; and suspected they had something to do with cancer. And he was furious. He explained why in three sentences: &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t tell me everything. She&#x2019;s my mother. I have the right to know what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d;<i>The boy was absolutely correct.</i> And what he said points up one of the central themes of this book: <i>The children of seriously or gravely ill parents always have the right to know what&#x2019;s going on</i>. Not only is that knowledge their right; it is one of their greatest needs.The second story involves a father, a successful and self-assured businessman recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Once again, the parents decided not to tell their children, a nine-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy. The parents were pretty sure the children knew anyway, and they were right.<i>The children always know.</i> Or, at least, they always know <i>something.</i>The normally cheerful little girl was constantly sad, suddenly breaking into tears. One night she begged her mother, &#x201c;Whatever you do, tell me the truth. Tell me Daddy&#x2019;s going to be okay.&#x201d; Neither realized that the little girl was asking for two different things. So the mother did what she thought was right: She told her daughter something she wasn&#x2019;t at all sure of: &#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;s going to be okay.&#x201d;The boy&#x2019;s symptoms were even more disturbing: While previously he&#x2019;d never shown much interest in toy guns and warfare, suddenly all his play was about killing. He ran around, indoors and out, making finger guns, shouting &#x201c;Bang, bang, you&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d; Death was the constant message; of his sister he said, &#x201c;I just wish she was dead.&#x201d; The boy was now totally indifferent to his father; it was as if the father were not there.Counseling the parents, I told them what to me was obvious, and what is the central message of this book: <br><b>You must tell your children the truth.</b><br>We&#x2019;ll talk a good deal throughout this manual about why that&#x2019;s so. But for the moment, here are three reasons: <br><b><i>1.</i> Your children are affected by everything that happens in the family.</b><b><i>2</i>. The more serious the situation, the more they will be impacted.</b><b><i>3</i>. Lying to your children, in any way, will inevitably make things worse.</b><br>But this father resisted; he was adamant that his children not be told of his lung cancer, <i>even though they obviously already knew.</i> And finally he told me why:&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you understand? If I tell the children I have cancer, that <i>means I really do</i>. How can I fight this thing, keep a positive attitude, do what the doctors say I must do, if I acknowledge that?&#x201d;Like the reaction of the boy in the first story, the father&#x2019;s reaction was absolutely normal. For <i>anyone</i> diagnosed with a serious illness, the first thought is for the self: How can I live and fight; how will I handle the long, intense, perhaps painful course of treatment; how can I cope with the possibility, however unlikely, that I may not survive?For a while, <i>everything revolves around the self.</i> Only afterward come thoughts of family, of how this most personal crisis may impinge on the people we love. Yet the needs of those loved ones, particularly of our children, are immediate and pressing.(In this case we reached a compromise: The father agreed that his wife should tell their children the full truth about his lung cancer. But she would also tell them, &#x201c;Daddy can&#x2019;t talk about it now.&#x201d; Frequently, in the first days and weeks after diagnosis, it is the well parent who must deal most directly with children&#x2019;s needs and questions. We found an acceptable interim solution, until the father could deal both with the disease and with his children&#x2014;until he <i>can</i> &#x201c;talk about it now.&#x201d;)Two needs collide: the patient&#x2019;s need to do whatever it takes to try to survive (if that includes fantasy and magic, so be it) versus the child&#x2019;s absolute, inescapable right and need to know the truth. The tension between those two needs is where this book begins.<b>MAKING YOUR CHILDREN PART OF YOUR TREATMENT</b>We believe very deeply that, when a parent is seriously ill, the children must be treated right along with the adult. Indeed, the children&#x2019;s treatment is <i>part</i> of the parent&#x2019;s treatment.Ideally, treating your children begins on the day of diagnosis&#x2014;the day you learn that you or your spouse has a serious, possibly life-threatening illness. That is the best moment to bring your children into the frightening picture.But: � It is almost never too late to start doing things the right way. Specifically, whatever point you may now have reached in your family medical crisis, whatever has already happened that may be creating problems for and with your children, <i>right now</i> is not too late to start handling things better. And that&#x2019;s because:� Mistakes made with love are easy to correct.<b>Avoiding the Biggest Mistake</b>The guiding principles, from the beginning to whatever the end may be, are <i>openness</i> and <i>honesty.</i>Being honest can be painful. Nevertheless, dishonesty, even with the honorable goal of protecting the children, <i>may be the single biggest mistake you as a parent can now make.</i>We are looking at the rest of your children&#x2019;s lives. If they are deceived, lied to, &#x201c;protected&#x201d; from the truth, they will learn a lifelong lesson of distrust. There may be nothing more important in their lives than that they continue to trust the two people they love most&#x2014;the parent who is sick and the parent who will continue to care for them.Counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists see them in their thirties and forties. And they say, &#x201c;Doctor, I can&#x2019;t love anyone.&#x201d; And so often, when you look back, there was a real break in that love during that person&#x2019;s childhood. Very often the break can be traced to the illness or death of a parent&#x2014;a break never brought out and handled by the child.<b>Children Are Stronger Than You Think</b>There is one thing I count on absolutely in my work with families and that you can count on now: Your children love you. Because they love you, they can handle what is coming; they are much stronger than you think possible. What we must do now is build on that love and so build that strength.As this medical crisis forces its way into your life and your children&#x2019;s, what we will try to do is maintain a sense of trust and continuity of parenting&#x2014;so that, whatever happens, your children retain their trust in the world and in the people who care for them and care about them. <b>THREE THINGS TO TELL YOUR CHILDREN</b>Whatever your children&#x2019;s ages, what you are going to do at this point is: � Tell them you are seriously ill.� Tell them the <i>name</i> of your disease.� Tell them your best understanding of what may happen.(As we&#x2019;ll see shortly, being honest does not mean telling everything. Children can absorb different levels of complexity at different ages, and you are the best judge of what your own child can understand. What it <i>does</i> mean, simply, is never telling anything but the truth.)Before we go on to <i>how</i> to tell children at different ages, let me tell you one story that illustrates <i>why</i> they must be told.A young mother was diagnosed with cancer. It was a kind of chronic leukemia whose treatment causes few visible symptoms; the parents decided they&#x2019;d spare their nine-year-old daughter the worry. All the child knew was that Mom was going to the hospital now and again to get some medicine, not even staying overnight. No big deal.One night, about two weeks after the mother was diagnosed, her daughter woke up in the middle of the night screaming.She couldn&#x2019;t move her legs.The little girl was rushed to Children&#x2019;s Hospital and evaluated thoroughly. There seemed to be no medical reason for her paralysis. The pediatrician&#x2014;fortunately, a very good one&#x2014;asked the mother whether anyth...</p><h2>Recovery: A Guide for Adult Children of Alcoholics</h2><p>Rich with insight and awareness, <i>Recovery</i> explores the secrets, fears, hopes and issues that confront adult children of alcoholics.

The stories she was hearing sounded just like hers! The other people in this group, who looked so picture-perfect, had experienced the same abandonment, the same loss of childhood, the same sense of betrayal that she had felt in a home dominated by an alcoholic parent.<br><br>Ann, who had recently celebrated her eighty-first birthday, relaxed as she heard others describe the embarrassment of their childhoods -- the humiliations, the insults, the times they were afraid to come home, and those terrible holiday scenes. As the shrouds of silence slowly disappeared, she was no longer feeling isolated and alone. There were no secrets here. These were her stories too.<br><br>Brian was trembling. He was thinking of his parents. Pangs of guilt pierced his stomach. For the first time he actually talked about what went on in his family. He dared say out load to others that his parents were alcoholic. He fidgeted as he forced himself not to pretend anymore. But it was hard! Scary! Yet, somewhere at the edge of his awareness, there was a feeling, a real feeling, that he did not want to deny.<br><br>Eric felt detached, as if he were a million miles away. He did not like to think about what had happened. He wanted to forget. What was the use anyway? Nothing changes; nothing really makes a difference. If only he could get rid of those recurring nightmares. He barely remembers them in the morning. He just knows they come.</i><br><br>The Leslies, Anns, Brians, Erics, and the millions of others like them, are adult children of alcoholics. Reared in a home in which one or both parents are alcoholic, they are united by the bondage of parental alcoholism. Most adult children of alcoholics have always suspected that something is wrong. They often experience loneliness and they are likely to believe that they are different from other people. They are! Without fully identifying the source of their emptiness, they have endured and suffered. They have survived the experience of living in a family where unpredictability was the one thing that could be counted on. They seldom knew what to expect from parents -- a frown or a smile, a slap or a kiss. They have survived the experience of living in a family where inconsistency was the rule. No two days were the same and they could not believe in what others said. Subjected to denial, broken promises, and lies, they were often at the mercy of parents whose feelings, perceptions and judgments were clouded by a mind-altering drug -- alcohol. They have survived the experience of living in a family where everything was arbitrary -- things were always happening by whim or impulse in ways that seemed out of control. And because their families were like this, they have survived living with a family in chaos. Almost every day there were crises and emergencies at home. It was never really safe to relax -- or be a child. Since their families represented their worlds, they lived in a world of unpredictability, inconsistency, arbitrariness, and chaos. These are the children of alcoholics.<br><br>This book is for these survivors, the children who grew up in an alcoholic family and became adults. It describes the costs they have had to pay to survive. More important, it presents a way they can re-evaluate their survival techniques in light of the problems they now face as adults. This book will help adult children of alcoholics to use these techniques as resources to propel themselves forward to a life of meaning and joy. As one adult child of an alcoholic said, "If I can use the debris of outrageous misfortune and turn it into something positive, then none of what happened to me occurred without rhyme or reason."<br><br>This book reflects recent changes in the field of alcoholism and growing efforts to identify and assist adult children of alcoholics. New and exciting things are happening. It was not until 1955 that alcoholism was recognized as a disease by the American Medical Association. In the 1960s and 1970s it slowly became increasingly clear to professionals that the family develops a parallel disease of its own. And in the late 1970s and early 1980s, explicit acknowledgment has been given to the adult survivors. Then, on Valentine's Day of 1983, the National Association for Children of Alcoholics was formed to recognize the needs and problems of children of alcoholics of all ages. Yes, things are happening!<br><br>This book is a part of what is happening. It is about a neglected minority numbering in the millions. Recent estimates indicate there are between 28 and 34 million children of alcoholics, over half of them adults. Because their survival behaviors tend to be approval-seeking and socially acceptable, the problems of most children (and adult children) of alcoholics remain invisible. It is not that they are not being treated. They are -- in mental health agencies, psychotherapists' offices, hospitals, employee assistance programs, and the judicial system. But the importance of their parents' alcoholism often does not receive the focus and attention it merits. Despite the increasing recognition of alcoholism as a family disease, children of alcoholics continue to be ignored, misdiagnosed, and inappropriately treated. Many limp into adulthood behind a facade of strength. They survive adulthood, too, but do not enjoy it.<br><br>This is a book about how children of alcoholics of all ages can begin to enjoy their adult lives. We want to share what we have been learning from the adult children of alcoholics we have encountered as therapists and educators. Most of all we want to share our enthusiasm and excitement as well as convey a message of hope and understanding. We have seen dramatic, positive changes in adult children of alcoholics once they understand how their earlier experience with familial alcoholism continues to influence them.<br><br>We invite you to join us on a journey in which we are all pioneers. The journey will help you to uncover the influence of family alcoholism. The approach we will use is a question and answer format. The questions addressed are those we have been asked most frequently by adult children of alcoholics. As we have journeyed with others, we have come to appreciate that there will be a number of responses to what is discovered. Some people are surprised, shocked, or overwhelmed by the answers. Some become angry and frustrated. Others remain skeptical and want to know where the "research" is. Some become very sad and cry, while others feel relief, elation, and hope. Few remain unaffected. There are reasons for the strong emotional responses provoked by the questions and answers presented in this book.<br><br>First and foremost, we will be talking about all those things that children of alcoholics of all ages are taught <i>not</i> to talk about. One of the cardinal rules in an alcoholic home is, "There's nothing wrong here and don't you dare tell anybody!" So we are most reverently breaking the shroud of silence that encases the alcoholic family. We dare to discuss things as they are, not as they should be or as you might like them to be. We know alcoholism is one of the most prevalent diseases; one in three families are affected. The alcoholic family is "the family next door." Alcoholism is also a complex and puzzling disease; we still do not know exactly what causes it. We know it is a devastating disease. It affects the body, mind, and spirit. It affects the individual, family, and society. It is generational. And because it is generational it affects the future. There are almost 15 million Americans suffering from alcoholism or problem drinking. Their numbers are increasing by almost half a million people each year. Over 75 million Americans are affected and alcoholism costs this country over $120 billion a year. Every two and one-half minutes there is an alcohol related death.<br><br>Second, adult children of alcoholics are profoundly affected when they overcome the barrier of denial because this requires them to confront the consequences of this ravaging disease in a very personal way. Children of alcoholics are at maximum risk of becoming alcoholic themselves or developing other addictive behavior. They are at the risk of marrying an alcoholic, one or several times. And they are at the risk of developing predictable problematic patterns of behavior in which they get stuck over and over again. Yet most do not even understand what hit them. There is no such thing as growing up unaffected when alcoholism is present in a family, but it is difficult for the individual to acknowledge these problems. Arrested emotional development is inescapable unless the effects of this disease are dealt with. Alcohol is an equal opportunity destroyer. Whoever gets in its path is affected.<br><br>Third, a multitude of powerful feelings is provoked when the individual begins to come to terms with the past. Over and over we have seen adult children experience spontaneous age regression. This means that as adult children break the denial and silence, they find themselves thrown back to the past. Particular words, music, or places trigger memories from childhood. Some of these experiences have not been remembered or felt in years. Some are pleasant; many are not. All are real. Remembering and exploring the effects of growing up with alcoholism in the family is part of a larger process of learning, growth, and development. In other words, this is a journey of change. And change is always scary. No matter how miserable you are, at least your life is predictable as it is. Adult children of alcoholics often confuse stability with consistency and rigidly cling to what is familiar even though it is destructive.<br><br>Adult children of alcoholics already know much of what we shall discuss. They just do not know that they know! Our task is to make this knowledge more accessible, meaningful, and useful. We believe that in each of us there is a core of wisdom and strength. The human mind has more resources than it can possibly use. It is a vast territory of undiscovered potential. We believe people make the best choices they can with the information they have and that with new information they will make better choices. While this means our parents made the best choices they could, it does not mean that they did not make terrible mistakes at times. We believe that people grow best in an atmosphere of freedom and choice; that people with the most choices are usually the healthiest and happiest. Sometimes adult children of alcoholics are so eager to change that they will reject valuable parts of themselves. Yet there is a positive aspect to almost every part of us if we can just find the right context for its expression.<br><br>In reading this book, you may find that your experiences do not match everything that is described. Use this material as a place to begin. Take what is helpful and leave the rest. We could not possibly cover everything and we have probably left out some questions that are important to you. Begin to trust the validity of your own experiences, knowing you will make sense out of our words and find your own meaning. It is up to you to decide what kind of changes you want to make, if any, and how this book can best serve your needs. You can decide, for instance, how much of this book to read, when to read it, and with whom to share it. Sometimes the best way to move quickly is to go slowly! Honor your own pace and speed. It has been our experience that the book works best when read in sequence. However, maximum benefit will come if you also feel free to put the book down at times. Taking a walk, talking to a friend, developing a support system, or going to Al-Anon can help you get through difficult sections. Reading the book when you are under the influence of alcohol or other drugs will not be helpful.<br><br>Finally, this book provides a way to share the questions and experiences of adult children of alcoholics. Together, we will explore the inner workings of an alcoholic family. We will discover what roles the children adopt and how these bear on their adult lives. We will look at the personal and interpersonal difficulties in which adult children frequently become enmeshed. We will also talk about what can be done to overcome these difficulties and describe the recovery process. We will show that traumatic incidents in childhood can lead to abilities and personal strengths that the individual can draw upon during the recovery process. We will see how strength can be restored from wounding. We shall discover new paths to freedom.<br><br>So we welcome you on what we anticipate will be a most important journey -- your journey, your recovery. It is time!<br><br>Copyright � 1985 by Herbert L. Gravitz and Julie D.

What's it like working on a huge initiative like The New 52?</strong></p> <p>A. FRANCIS MANAPUL: It's a dream come true! I've been clamoring to work on this book for years, so to be able to take the driver side seat is a huge honor. To steer The Flash's adventures for this new era in the DC Universe has been daunting and exciting all at the same time.</p> <p>A. BRIAN BUCCELLATO: It&#x2019;s been a huge thrill! Taking the reigns of an iconic character like the Flash and reintroducing him to the revamped DC Universe was a rare opportunity that we didn&#x2019;t take lightly. Francis and I were honored to be able to put our stamp on the character.</p> <p><strong>Q. How are you balancing making these stories and characters feel fresh and new while still respecting what came before?</strong></p> <p>A. BRIAN BUCCELLATO: The Flash is a character that has endured for over seventy years, so there was ample source material to draw upon as we designed our take on the Scarlet Speedster. We did a ton of research and tried to stay as true to him as we could when choosing how best to bring him into the New 52. Understanding the character is paramount to being able to respect what came before. We know who Barry is and that colors all of our decisions as we mapped out new directions for the book and lessons he has to learn.</p> <p>A. FRANCIS MANAPUL: As a long time fan of the Flash, I do feel a sense of responsibility to strike a balance. However like Brian said, having done the research, we understand the essence of the Barry Allen. This allows us to put him in a modern setting and add our own voice to the character, but at the same time remaining true to the heart of the character.</p> <p><strong>Q. What would you say defines The Flash?</strong></p> <p>A. BRIAN BUCCELLATO: Barry has a strong sense of honor and a classic hero&#x2019;s moral compass. He is not a tortured or motivated by guilt or a personal agenda. Barry believes that he was &#x201c;chosen&#x201d; to have this amazing gift and that being Flash is what he is &#x201c;meant to do.&#x201d;</p> <p>A. FRANCIS MANAPUL: Barry has a very black and white sense of justice, and this world full of gray areas constantly challenge his ideals.</p> <p><strong>Q. What have you thought about the response so far for The New 52 and The Flash as a whole?</strong></p> <p>A. BRIAN BUCCELLATO: We couldn&#x2019;t be more thrilled with the reception of Flash and the New 52 as a whole. In the dozens of conventions and signings we have done this past year, there has been palpable excitement and enthusiasm for our book and for DC&#x2019;s courageous re-launching of the universe. It was a much needed shot in the arm that has clearly re-invigorated the industry. On a selfish level, it is an incredible feeling to have so many die-hard Flash fans embrace our take on the book, while at the same time bring new Flash fans into the fold. </p> <p><strong>Q. The Flash really pushes the boundaries of art and storytelling. Can you talk a little about how, or if you see yourselves doing so?</strong></p> <p>A. FRANCIS MANAPUL: The marriage of art and words is what comics are about. With such a small creative team, what you're seeing in The Flash is much more raw and unfiltered. Being a co-writer on the book allows me the opportunity to really push how we tell the story visually. Knowing what our intent is lets me do things in and outside of the panel that tell a story within a story. We definitely reward those who read our book more than once.</p> <p>A. BRIAN BUCCELLATO: I think this is a natural outcome because there are only two of us working on the book. Since we co-write it, Francis does the art, and I do the colors, we are able to fold all of the steps into our creative process. We are both visual storytellers, so it&#x2019;s not like there is even a decision to push any boundaries. The finished product is a COMPLETE visual representation of what the writers wanted because there is no loss of translation.</p> <p><strong>Q. You two work in two different cities in two different countries. How do you guys work together creatively?</strong></p> <p>A. BRIAN BUCCELLATO: SKYPE, and lots of it. We take advantage of all the modern means of communication.... Skype, email, text, and even the phone. We discuss the stories in great length before retreating to our workstations to do our parts. We also pass the baton back and forth, creatively building upon what we have talked about. There is also a ten-year friendship and a mutual understanding of each other, that gives us a shorthand that makes the process go smoother. For my part, there is no one I would rather be making comics with.</p> <p>A. FRANCIS MANAPUL: The key is communication. Like Brian said, we use every available tool in order to keep our geographical location a non-issue. I feel like we're sculptors. When we write we pass the files back and forth like a piece of clay we are molding. What you get is a finished piece with both of our fingerprints all over it, without having to be in the same room.</p>Francis Manapul is the artist and co-writer of <i>The Flash</i>, which is part of DC Comics&#x2014;The New 52.

With this work, Adrian Tomine (<i>Shortcomings</i>,<i> Scenes from an Impending Marriage</i>) reaffirms his place not only as one of the most significant creators of contemporary comics but as one of the great voices of modern American literature. His gift for capturing emotion and intellect resonates here: the weight of love and its absence, the pride and disappointment of family, the anxiety and hopefulness of being alive in the twenty-first century.<br> "Amber Sweet" shows the disastrous impact of mistaken identity in a hyper-connected world; "A Brief History of the Art Form Known as Hortisculpture" details the invention and destruction of a vital new art form in short comic strips; "Translated, from the Japanese" is a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images; the title story, "Killing and Dying", centers on parenthood, mortality, and stand-up comedy. In six interconnected, darkly funny stories, Tomine forms a quietly moving portrait of contemporary life.<br> Tomine is a master of the small gesture, equally deft at signaling emotion via a subtle change of expression or writ large across landscapes illustrated in full color.<i> Killing and Dying</i> is a fraught, realist masterpiece.</p></p><p><p><b>Adrian Tomine</b> was born in 1974 in Sacramento, California.

They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Eric Carle lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.

On April 26, 1777, in Patterson (now Ludington), NY, Colonel Ludington received word that the British were attacking and burning Danbury, CT. His 16-year-old daughter eagerly volunteered to spread the word and gather his troops in a dangerous midnight ride. Traveling over dirt roads in pouring rain, encountering outlaws, and battling fatigue, she accomplished her mission. As a result of her efforts, the troops arrived in time to push the British back to their boats rather than complete their march into New York. The afterword explains the young woman's further role in America's fight for independence. The full or half-page watercolor illustrations complement the straightforward, simple text.

Describing Dante&#39;s descent into Hell midway through his life with Virgil as a guide, Inferno depicts a cruel underworld in which desperate figures are condemned to eternal damnation for committing one or more of seven deadly sins. As he descends through nine concentric circles of increasingly agonising torture, Dante encounters doomed souls including the pagan Aeneas, the liar Odysseus, the suicide Cleopatra, and his own political enemies, damned for their deceit. Led by leering demons, the poet must ultimately journey with Virgil to the deepest level of all.

Married to Gemma Donatic, Dante&#39;s political activism resulted in his being exiled from Florence to eventually settle in Ravenna.

Original introduction by Global Alliance Publications, Inc. summarizes the powerful book series. In this trilogy, Professor Anthony C. Sutton presents extensive research tracing the support and financial backing of world-changing events by Wall Street including the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Franklin Delano Roosevelt s presidency, Hitler s rise to power, World War II and the beginnings of corporate socialism. Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution Learn how major corporations made deals to capture huge Russian markets over a decade before the U.S. even recognized the Soviet regime. And, how closet socialism permeated the top levels of business only to later expand across many facets of society under the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, all to benefit the interests of Wall Street. Wall Street and FDR Other histories gloss over Franklin Delano Roosevelt s years on Wall Street, but Sutton reveals his destructive speculation, behind the scenes use of political influence for profit, and the corporations and elite businessmen who made his rise to the Presidency possible. Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler Hitler rose to power through subsidies by international bankers and Wall Street financiers. Sutton presents original documents and eyewitness accounts to show how World War II was well-planned and extremely profitable for top financial insiders. Read how the directors and executives of J.P. Morgan, General Electric, Standard Oil, International Telephone and Telegraph, Chase and Manhattan banks and many other members of the business elite all played a role in financing and promoting one of the most destructive wars in history. Throughout the 20th century, bankers and executives from institutions even more relevant today, including Morgan banking, used their resources to shape the global structure of events in order to maximize profit and maintain their level of world influence. Given that these companies still exert influence in our political system and our society as a whole, Professor Sutton s conclusions are just as relevant today as they were when he originally published his findings.</p><p></p><h2>Woman on the Edge of Time: A Novel</h2><p>Hailed as a classic of speculative fiction, Marge Piercy&#x2019;s landmark novel is a transformative vision of two futures&#x2014;and what it takes to will one or the other into reality.

The signs of an impending marital separation; experiences that may occur with divided custody; and common emotions of sorrow, anger, and loneliness are addressed. Questions designed to help youngsters discuss various aspects of their situations are interspersed throughout the narrative. The language is simple and impersonal. Guidelines for adults and names of useful organizations are appended. Pleasant, brightly colored, cartoon-style pictures of varied sizes and shapes show a boy and girl and their parents in various stages of the family breakup and the reconfiguration of their lives. Although psychologically correct, the book lacks the appeal of Laurene Browns Dinosaurs Divorce (Little, Brown, 1986), which is accurate but also gently witty.Patricia Pearl Dole, formerly at First Presbyterian School, Martinsville, VA <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Transformers: The IDW Collection Volume 2</h2><p><ul> <li>The re-presentation of IDW's Transformers Universe continues in volume 2!

With occasional rhymes, the short, poetic lines are conversational and instructive and evoke a sense of mystery.... What kids will respond to immediately, though, are the noisy, delicious sounds and rhythms in the words as well as the kinetic energy in the beautifully composed, atmospheric digital illustrations, which have the richly patterned and textured look of paint-and-paper collage. Playfully arranged type in changing fonts adds to the visual fun while giving cues for energizing read-alouds. On the final, stunning spreads, a mother&#x2019;s hair swirls into a wave of water that becomes a joyful spiral of living creatures, all reinforcing the simple, profound message: our lives depend on 'so precious' water."<br> --<i>BOOKLIST</i>, March 15, 2011, <b>*STAR</b><br><br>* &#x201c;Lyon briefly explains the water cycle in lyrical verse and celebrates its power to give life... The digital collage like illustrations pair dramatically with the text to depict this contrast. Turquoise endpapers usher in pages with swirls of water, water spouting from a hose, through pipes, down mountains. Rain pours down in horizontal and vertical spreads. But brown and cream-colored pages reveal a bare landscape where a little girl and animals alike anxiously anticipate an approaching rain cloud. At last, &#x201c;this wet wonder&#x201d; arrives and flows through all creatures, including a young child and mother whose water-sprinkled hair spreads across the pages to become a swirl of tiny creatures and plants. &#x201c;Honey, living things dream of water...so precious,&#x201d; says the narrator. We must &#x201c;keep it clear, keep it clean... keep Earth green!&#x201d; Filled with rhythm and sound, this offering begs to be read aloud.&#x201d;<br> --<i>School Library Journal,</i> May 2011, <b>*STAR</b><br><br>&#x201c;Lyon celebrates the essence of life itself in a lyrical presentation of the water cycle...Meanwhile, in sweeping, digitally rendered art resembling watercolor and collage, Tillotson creates luxuriant ocean swirls and pelting streaks of rain...It&#x2019;s a familiar subject but a vital one, to which author and illustrator bring a passion and artistry that give it the power of story.&#x201d;<br> --<i>The Horn Book Magazine, </i>May/June 2011<br><br>"This book totally immerses the reader in the water cycle. From blue end papers and thrashing water on the title page, we&#x2019;re taken to a view of the tiny blue planet Earth from space. From space, the author moves to the familiar: water coming from a hose, puddles, and a cup of water. The author explains the water cycle using a wealth of vocabulary quite artfully and effectively. You <i>feel</i> the words. Evaporation is shown by having the words &#x201c;swirl up&#x201d; and rise up the page from the sea. The use of blues, purples, and greens to convey wetness is quite effective, as is the use of browns and beige depicting a place where very little water is available. There is total integration of illustration and text. A child reading this book will understand the water cycle, and that they need to be good water stewards. This is a good science read-aloud for the primary grades." <br> <b>Highly Recommended</b><br> <i>- Library Media Connection</i>, October 2011</p><h2>The Common Core Companion: The Standards Decoded, Grades 9-12: What They Say, What They Mean, How to Teach Them (Corwin Literacy)</h2><p><p><strong><em>That version of the 9-12 standards you wish you had</em></strong></p> <p>If you&#x2019;re a high school teacher, no need to despair.

At first things went smoothly for the Clinton 12, but then outside agitators interfered, pitting the townspeople against one another. Uneasiness turned into anger, and even the Clinton Twelve themselves wondered if the easier thing to do would be to go back to their old school. Jo Ann--clear-eyed, practical, tolerant, and popular among both black and white students---found herself called on as the spokesperson of the group. But what about just being a regular teen? This is the heartbreaking and relatable story of her four months thrust into the national spotlight and as a trailblazer in history. Based on original research and interviews and featuring backmatter with archival materials and notes from the authors on the co-writing process.</p><p><p><b>Debbie Levy</b> is the author of many books, including I Dissent; The Year of Goodbyes: A True Story of Friendship, Family, and Farewells; and Imperfect Spiral. She lives in the Chesapeake Bay area. </p><br><p><b>Jo Ann Allen Boyce </b>was one of twelve students to desegragate Clinton High School in 1956. She has worked as a professional singer and a nurse. She lives in Los Angeles.</p>Gr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;This evocatively told, carefully researched memoir-in-verse is the story of a group of 12 teenagers from Clinton, TN, who, in 1956, were among the first black students to pave the way for school integration. Free verse and formal poetry, along with newspaper headlines, snippets of legislation, and other primary sources about national and local history are mixed with Boyce's first-person narrative. The book opens with an overview of life in segregated Clinton and the national events leading up to the desegregation of Clinton High. The rest of the work follows the four months in the fall of 1956 when Boyce and the other 11 teens attended Clinton High. They faced angry white mobs outside the school, constant harassment from white classmates, and a hostile principal who viewed integration as a legal choice rather than a moral one. The book includes an introduction and epilogue, authors' notes, brief biographies of the involved students, photographs, a time line, and a bibliography. The writing invites readers to cheer on Boyce for her optimism and her stubbornness in the face of racism, without singling her out as a solitary hero. This story adeptly shows readers that, like the Clinton Twelve, they too can be part of something greater than themselves.

Readable, fundamental, and basic, it remains an essential book for students, aspiring managers, and seasoned professionals.</p></p><p><p>Peter F.

When she arrives to stay with her sister Stella in a crowded, boisterous corner of New Orleans, her delusions of grandeur bring her into conflict with Stella&#39;s crude, brutish husband Stanley. Eventually their violent collision course causes Blanche&#39;s fragile sense of identity to crumble, threatening to destroy her sanity and her one chance of happiness.</p><p>Tennessee Williams was born in 1911 in Columbus, Mississippi, where his grandfather was the episcopal clergyman. When his father, a travelling salesman, moved with his family to St Louis some years later, both he and his sister found it impossible to settle down to city life. He entered college during the Depression and left after a couple of years to take a clerical job in a shoe company. He stayed there for two years, spending the evenings writing. He entered the University of Iowa in 1938 and completed his course, at the same time holding a large number of part-time jobs of great diversity. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1940 for his play Battle of Angels, and he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 and 1955. Among his many other plays Penguin have published The Glass Menagerie (1944), Summer and Smoke (1948), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Camino Real (1953), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Orpheus Descending (1957), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), Period of Adjustment (1960), The Night of the Iguana (1961), The Milk Train Doesn&#39;t Stop Here Anymore (1963; revised 1964) and Small Craft Warnings (1972).To listen to this riveting performance, recorded live at Lincoln Center in 1973, is a revelation. It takes the listener right to the heart of what makes Tennessee Williams&#39;s 1947 Pulitzer Prize-winning play a literary icon--the words, every last word. From the lilting sounds of Blanche DuBois&#39;s fragile and flighty poetic visions to the staccato tones of Stanley Kowalski&#39;s streetwise poker games, the performances weave image after image. There are few histrionics in Rosemary Harris, James Farentino, and Patricia Conolly&#39;s naturalistic portrayals of Blanche, Stanley, and Stella. Their vocal choices make the play&#39;s final scenes sound all the more credible, and devastating. A classic performance of an American classic. B.P.

This intimate and personal view into Vixen's life is chronicled through a beautifully cohesive relationship between text and illustration. Facts and definitions are seamlessly woven into the narrative. When Vixen sniffs the air, readers learn that "a fox is a canine, related to dogs and wolves. Canines have super sensitive noses and ears. Vixen can smell faint odors and hear tiny sounds that a human would never hear." Readers later witness a combination of Vixen's senses put to use when she leaps and dives to capture a mouse hidden underneath a foot of snow. Conveying the intensity and precision of this specific hunt, the art, rendered with pastels and aqua crayons on sanded paper, also fuels the foxlike moments with emotion, from Vixen and her mate's tender nuzzle to the curiosity and playfulness of her four kits. Additional facts are located in the back matter.

What began with an introduction to a major paradigm shift in <em>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</em> turned into a discussion of aligning our personalities with our soul in <em>The Seat of the Soul</em>; finally, in <em>Spiritual Partnership</em>, Zukav guides the reader on this practical path to authentic power.</p><p><br><br><strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Personal Note from Gary Zukav</strong><br><br> <p> </p> I wrote <em>Spiritual Partnership: The Journey to Authentic Power</em> to try to get out of my own cage. I wanted, and needed, to connect with people, not just reach them, but really connect for my own well being and hopefully for theirs as well.<br><br> I have learned that the difficult times in my life are not because of other people, they are because of me. They occur because of parts of my personality that are painful to experience. When I am with someone who brings them up in me, that is a painful time, but I know that it is not about the other person when I feel angry or impatient or irritable. It is about me, and so I am intent to use my experiences with others to learn about me so that I can change me because I am really tired of trying to change other people. And not only am I tired of it, I don't want to. It doesn&#x2019;t feel good. I know deep in me that it is a wrong path for me to take, and I feel that it is a painful path for anyone to take. <br><br> Spiritual partnership is a partnership with another person or other people who feel the same way. It is a partnership between equals for the purpose of spiritual growth. So when my spiritual partners and I have difficult interactions, we do not point fingers at each other, we try our best to respond instead of react, and to support one another in doing that also. Spiritual partnership is a new kind of relationship, a different kind of relationship. We do more than talk about hair styles, life styles, car styles, children, and work. We do all those things too but those conversations take on a different meaning. While I am having them, I am noticing what I am feeling. I'm noticing if anything gets triggered in me and if it does, I pay attention to it, especially if I am becoming upset because those are the experiences that keep me from loving. They keep me apart from people. <br><br> For a long time I thought that if I could change people enough, and get some that were just right around me, it would be easy to be loving, but it doesn't work like that because everybody has parts of her or his personality that are loving and also parts that are not loving. I would say the not-loving parts are the frightened parts of the personality, the parts that are angry, jealous, vengeful, feel superior, feel inferior, etc. And when these parts become active, and this always happens sooner or later, that's when the learning potential begins. Of course, it also begins when the loving parts come out, the parts that are grateful, patient, appreciative, content, etc. Being a spiritual partner means really wanting to support people because you see when they are in pain how they might learn from their pain, too, if they're open. If they&#x2019;re open. <br><br> My focus is on changing myself because I know that other people can&#x2019;t change me, but I also know that each of my spiritual partners wants to change himself or herself, too. He wants to find and challenge the painful, destructive parts of his personality and cultivate the constructive, blissful parts of his personality, and so I assist him whenever I think I see that they might be active. I don';t just say "This is what is happening in you, and this is what you ought to do." I ask her if she is open to looking at something that I think I might be seeing. For example, some parts of my personality that I have become very familiar with over years feel superior, entitled, impatient, and don't really care about the needs of others, but not everybody is like that. One of my spiritual partners feels a need to please other people when a frightened part of her personality is active; to see them smile or value her because of what she can do or give. So when I see that part come out in her behaviors and thoughts and attitudes, if she is open I will help her see them. And there are specific ways, very helpful ways that we can assist one another. This book gives them to you.<br><br> Once I started this book I kept writing because it felt so good. I love it when creativity begins to flow and I can think of a better way to express something--a story, or a metaphor, or a process. I love that experience of sharing. The more I stretched myself to think, "How can I say this in a way that is not by rote? How can I not take refuge in what I know how to say but really communicate in an even more meaningful way?" the deeper my understanding of spiritual partnership became and the stronger my ability to share it. One idea lead to another, one chapter lead to another, and after a few chapters I began to see an outline for the book, and that outline became WHY, WHAT, HOW, and WHO. That';s how this book unfolded.<br><br> There is a saying that people teach what they really need to learn. Doing this in a heart-felt way has worked well for me. I can tell that I am becoming more able to connect with people because to my surprise I have become interested in them. Let me put it this way, I am aware now, much more aware of how important people are to me than I have been in the past. I like hearing their stories. I like hearing what is happening in their lives. For example, Linda Francis, the spiritual partner I live with, and I met a couple on a plane and found them to be wonderful. He told me that he has pancreatic cancer and that he and his wife were going on a cruise to Mexico. When he learned that his illness was terminal, he realized that he could spend his last days in a hospital, but that didn't sound inviting to him. Or he could spend them really living his life, and that invited him. That is what he is doing. What I really like about him is his aliveness, his interest, his interest in me and his excitement for what I am doing. He is as grounded as he is delightful and vibrant. He said, "I am a little afraid of what it will be like to die. I am not sure about that. I know I am going to get sick. I have done my homework on pancreatic cancer. It is an ugly way to die, but I feel so alive and so grateful for every moment." In the little time we were together, I learned about myself as well as about him, but mostly I enjoyed myself and I enjoyed him, and I feel that he enjoyed himself and he enjoyed me. <br><br> So those are the kind of experiences that are coming into my life now. And I also know that when it comes to spirituality, I am not special. If I can create authentic power and spiritual partnerships, you can. If I can make the journey from an angry, drug-using, sex-addicted, motorcycle-riding, angry--did I mention angry?--young man to someone who is now enjoying becoming an elder, anyone can. As I began to open my heart up many wonderful role models came into my life over the years, men and women who have opened their hearts or are opening them, and they are still coming. Perhaps I can be one of those role models for you, and you can be one for someone else. We are all opening our hearts, but it is not a matter of opening your heart and, there, that's a done deal. It is a matter of continuing to open your heart moment by moment. This book is about that, and how to do it. <br><br> Love,<br><br> Gary Zukav<br><br><p>This book is about our new relationships. A new and surprising world is emerging that requires each of us to explore the sources of our love and cultivate them and the inner sources of all that prevents us from loving (our fears) and heal them. Our evolution has taken a new path, and our relationships are changing in unexpected and dramatic ways. </p><p>We are evolving beyond the limits of our five senses and encountering more expanded experiences of ourselves and our world than were previously possible. Where once our perception was confined to what we see, hear, taste, touch, and smell, we are now increasingly able to access data that these senses cannot detect. This expanded perception is forever altering our experiences of ourselves, our world, and our relationships. </p><p>Our evolution now presents us at each moment with a profound choice: we can pretend that our lives and the world are not changing and continue to relate to one another as before, or we can use our relationships to transform ourselves into authentically powerful, loving individuals.</p><p>In <em>Spiritual Partnership</em>, bestselling author Gary Zukav reveals a profound new relationship dynamic that enables us to reach our full potential and create authentic power&#x2014;the fulfilling and joyful life that is calling to us all. Spiritual partnerships are not only for couples in marriage; they can be created anywhere two or more individuals decide to engage as equals for the purpose of spiritual development.</p><p>Filled with poignant examples and practical guidance, including specific guidelines, <em>Spiritual Partnership</em> empowers and enables us to explore our emotions, our intentions, our choices, and our intuition and to use them to create profound spiritual growth. The world is changing around us and within us, and <em>Spiritual Partnership</em> is the road map to that change. </p></p><h2>Casa Bohemia: The Spanish-Style House</h2><p><b>A celebration of the uniquely vibrant architecture and interiors of classic and new Spanish-style houses in the&nbsp;southwestern and southern&nbsp;United States,&nbsp;Mexico, and&nbsp;Spain.

Organized into 14 easy-to-follow chapters with titles such as &#x201c;Diets Don&#x2019;t Work&#x201d; and &#x201c;Spot Your Triggers,&#x201d; and written in a highly conversational and candid fashion, the book lays out a doable program designed to allow readers to gain a sense of control over their eating. The crux of the program, and where it begins, is with the process of eliminating troublesome foods linked to overeating and cravings. Upon completion of this strict 30-day period, dieters will reintroduce certain foods, one at a time, in order to identify which are most problematic. Though elimination diets are not new, Hartwig&#x2019;s approach differs from others, such as J.J. Virgin&#x2019;s Virgin Diet, in being primarily focused on psychological well-being rather than weight loss. Refreshingly, readers are assured that falling off the wagon is not failure, but just part of the process. Hartwig succeeds in making the case that seemingly uncontrollable desires for food truly can be conquered with hard work.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Hartwig is a co-creator of the Whole30, a program based on the elimination and reintroduction of potentially troublesome foods. This is not a diet, according to the author, but a lifetime plan aimed at stopping cravings, healing inflammation, and allowing eaters to savor and enjoy food without guilt. There are three parts to the plan: resetting (eliminating potentially troublesome foods, then reintroducing them systematically after 30 days), enjoying food freedom, and acknowledging slip-ups. Hartwig, a certified sports nutritionist, expands the original Whole30 structure by offering customizing options while still insisting on strict adherence to the chosen program. Hartwig supports her approach by citing scientific studies she interprets as demonstrating that the brain thrives on limited options. Promised results include less stress, better sleep, improved digestion, and more energy. What make this book particularly valuable are Hartwig&#x2019;s emphasis on non-scale-oriented victories and her practical strategies for handling inevitable backslides, naysayers, and stubborn old habits. The prospect of food freedom is appealing, and Hartwig&#x2019;s conversational style and no-nonsense stance make her plan seem doable.

Not the usual recurring one: this one was original. Original, but just as miserable. My dream was about my ex-wife, Monica. It was our wedding day. She looked stunningly beautiful in a champagne-colored strapless dress with pearl sequins. That part of the dream was good. Then it got weird.<br> <br>After our wedding we went to get on the plane for our honeymoon. Monica boarded first. Then, as I was about to get on, the door slammed in front of me, and the jet backed out to the runway, leaving me standing alone at the open end of the Jetway. I was still there when I saw her plane crash.<br> <br>I woke with a start. As I lay there, soaked in sweat, I could only think of her. My Monica. My pearl. I wondered if she had heard news of the crash and been told that I was on the flight. I wondered if she cried. I hoped she had. I wouldn&#x2019;t bet on it, but I hoped.<br> <br>I rolled over and went back to sleep. Hours later I woke with the sun in my face. I turned over and looked at my clock. It was already past ten. I rubbed my face, then groaned. My head was pounding from all I&#x2019;d drunk the night before. Instinctively, I was trying to remember what I had to do that day when it hit me that I had nothing to do. I was dead.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s liberating being dead. Remarkably. Zero responsibilities. Zero expectations. Actually, being a zero. A nothing. My reality was still settling in.<br> <br>As you deduced by my obituary, the world thinks I was killed in that plane crash. You probably remember hearing about the accident. For a while it dominated the media. United Flight 227 out of Chicago&#x2013;O&#x2019;Hare. The media reported that all 212 passengers and crew on board were killed. What they didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;what no one knew&#x2014;was that there were only 211 passengers on board.<br> <br>As stated flatteringly in my obituary, I was a seminar presenter. A stage salesman. I sold the Charles James Wealth package. In older days I would have been called a huckster or charlatan&#x2014;the successor of a snake-oil salesman. It&#x2019;s a prestigious line, really, attached to famous names like Rasputin and Charles Ponzi.<br> <br>Working the stage, I railed at people who believed in fate. &#x201c;Fate,&#x201d; I taught, &#x201c;is the refuge of losers who don&#x2019;t take responsibility for their lives.&#x201d; Professionally, I had to take this position. People who believe in fate don&#x2019;t buy high-priced wealth packages to change their future.<br> <br>Yet here I was, as swept away by circumstances as a swimmer pulled over Niagara Falls.<br> <br>Was fate the reason I was still alive? If so, why would it choose me to survive? Maybe fate has a sense of humor.<br> <br><br> <br>One thing I was certain of was that I couldn&#x2019;t stay in my house much longer. People would be coming. People always come together after a death. I wondered how it would happen. In most cases of death there are spouses and partners, mourning family, all connected to the deceased, coming together to complete the tasks and rituals of death.<br> <br>That wouldn&#x2019;t happen with me. My mother and brother were likely still alive, but I hadn&#x2019;t heard from either of them for more than a decade. The only familial obligation I had was a legal one. It was the child support payment I made monthly to Monica. I suppose that would be the first in a long series of legal actions.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t stay in the house, but I wasn&#x2019;t ready to leave Chicago either. As I lay in bed thinking about where to go, I heard a noise downstairs. Someone was opening my door. Someone with a key.<br> <br>My heart froze. Already? I walked out of my room and peered around the corner to see who it was.<br> <br>The door swung open. At first no one entered. Then a woman hobbled in sideways, awkwardly dragging two large suitcases. It was Marta, one of my cleaning ladies. She was a fairly recent addition to the crew. She spoke no English and mostly kept to herself. Now she had come to take my things. My first thought was to go charging downstairs, but I stopped myself. Was it worth losing my anonymity over a few knickknacks?<br> <br>Still, the thought of her stealing from me infuriated me. I felt as though I was living the fourth stave of A Christmas Carol, where people invade Scrooge&#x2019;s home to claim his belongings, stealing the very shirt from his body. &#x201c;Why wasn&#x2019;t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he&#x2019;d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>As I thought the situation through, I realized that I had nothing to lose in confronting her. First, who was she going to tell? She was new to America and didn&#x2019;t speak English. She could tell her boss, but since she had no business being in my house alone, she would likely be fired. Second, even if she somehow did tell someone, who would believe her? I was dead. Dead as a coffin nail. It was her word against the overwhelming crush of media.<br> <br>I quietly walked downstairs to the dining room, where Marta was putting a silver serving platter into one of her bags. That platter had been a Christmas gift from Amanda two years back. I waited until she finished, then said, &#x201c;Hola, Marta. Qu� tal?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if Marta&#x2019;s horror came from being caught stealing, seeing a ghost, or&#x2014;the worst possible scenario&#x2014;being caught stealing from a ghost, but no matter; she was out of my house like an Olympic sprinter off the starting blocks, leaving her loot and suitcases behind. Honestly, I didn&#x2019;t know she could move that fast. I wouldn&#x2019;t have guessed it from watching her clean my house.<br> <br>Back to my dilemma. As underscored by Marta&#x2019;s appearance, the fact was, I couldn&#x2019;t remain in my house. I needed a place to stay while I prepared for my journey.<br> <br>Fortunately, there were several hotels within walking distance, including one I&#x2019;d put a client up in just three blocks from my home. The Write Inn. I called and made a reservation.<br> <br>Next, to plan for my walk. My hiking equipment was kept in my garage in a storage bin that probably hadn&#x2019;t been opened since I&#x2019;d filled it. For someone who never hiked, I had premium equipment&#x2014;expensive and never used. I had purchased the bulk of it when I was dating a swimsuit model who liked to hike. We broke up before I had even taken the tags off the equipment.<br> <br>The first thing I retrieved from the locker was a backpack. All I knew about the pack was that the guy at the sporting goods store said it was one of the best ever made&#x2014;and their most expensive. Bizarrely, the second reason was more important than the first. I always bought the most expensive version of everything I purchased. Always. There was something deeply psychological about this habit. I bought the best of everything not necessarily because I wanted it&#x2014;there were actually times that I would have preferred another option. I bought the best because I could. I suppose that&#x2019;s what happens when you grow up with deprivation. You feel driven to purchase what you would have been denied before, just to prove that you can&#x2019;t be denied now.<br> <br>I filled my pack with only the most essential things: a water bottle, a rain tarp, a sleeping bag and inflatable pad, a one-man tent, and a small first-aid kit.<br> <br>In spite of my lack of camping experience, packing for the road wasn&#x2019;t especially daunting. I&#x2019;d been living on the road for months at a time, and it&#x2019;s not like I was heading to Nepal or hiking K2. What I didn&#x2019;t have I could always purchase. And since I would be carrying it all, I wanted everything to be as minimal as possible.<br> <br>I carried the pack back to my room, then emptied my travel hygiene kit, sorted through what I needed, and put it all in a small, waterproof bag, along with a bottle of hand sanitizer and a tub of Clorox disinfectant wipes. So much for my OCD.<br> <br>I filled the rest of the pack with clothing. I figured I would need more socks than usual. I packed rain gear, underwear, two pairs of light pants, and some basketball shorts. All softer fabrics and blends, nothing that would chafe. It was one of the few times in my recent life that I didn&#x2019;t pack a tie.<br> <br>I also packed a pair of sunglasses and one of those crushable wool felt fedoras that made me look like Indiana Jones.<br> <br>I went into my walk-in closet and pushed my suits to the side, revealing a wall safe. I took out a vinyl bank bag that contained the ten thousand dollars that I kept for emergencies. I don&#x2019;t know what kind of emergency would require 10k in cash, but it just seemed like a good idea. It was also where I kept my handgun, a 9 mm Smith &amp; Wesson, along with a box containing fifty rounds of ammo. I was probably the only one in my neighborhood with a gun. Or at least the only one who would admit it.<br> <br>I took out the Rolex watch my partners had given me in Las Vegas a few years back. It was an 18-karat gold President Day-Date with a diamond face. It retailed for more than fifty thousand dollars. The partners had given it to me to celebrate the milestone of the Charles James Wealth Seminars reaching a half-billion dollars in sales. It was the last time we met. We broke up the company three months later.<br> <br>Of course, a Rolex isn&#x2019;t the kind of watch one would usually take on a cross-country walking trip, but it wasn&#x2019;t something one would just leave behind either.<br> <br>In the back of the safe was something that had sat undisturbed since I put it in there seven years before. I reached in and pulled out a small black velvet jewelry box. It was of greater worth than the Rolex, not in price but in personal value. It felt almost like a religious relic. It was Monica&#x2019;s wedding ring. I snapped open the box, revealing a white gold band with a seawater pearl surrounded by marquise-cut diamonds. A pearl flower. It was the ring I&#x2019;d given to Monica when I asked her to marry me. I smiled as I remembered the look on her face as I gave it to her.<br> <br>My joy turned to pain as I remembered the look on her face as she took it off and set it on the stool behind the stage of the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The moment was frozen in time, like a car crash. Her words, spoken softly, still echoed as loudly as shredding steel: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not your pearl.&#x201d; I had thrown away my pearl of great price.<br> <br>I unhooked the gold chain I wore around my neck and attached the ring to it. I was walking to her. It was fitting that I kept it close to my heart.<br> <br>I went back to my nightstand and grabbed my leather journal. I was ultra-disciplined about writing in my journal. In fact, throughout my life I had filled twenty-three journals, which I stored in a private indoor storage site only Amanda knew about.<br> <br>I grabbed my phone, this time remembering my charger, and carried my pack downstairs.<br> <br>I locked the front door that Marta had opened and went to the kitchen. I opened the fridge and drank some milk directly from the carton, then poured the rest down the sink. I didn&#x2019;t know when, or even if, I would ever come back, but if I did, I didn&#x2019;t want to return to one-hundred-day-old milk.<br> <br>I slung the backpack over my shoulder and took a deep breath, taking in the moment. As I looked around, I felt a faint sentimentality toward the place. I had lived here for seven years, longer than any place else except for my childhood home. I had left that home because it was killing me. I left this one because I was dead.<br> <br>As I opened the back door, I softly spoke my mantra. &#x201c;There is no God but me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I locked the door and walked to the end of the yard, where I had climbed over the fence the night before. I looked over the fence. There was only a single oncoming car. I waited until it passed, then lowered my pack over the fence and climbed over.<br> <br>I opened my pack and brought out my hat and sunglasses. The hat sprang back into shape. The sunglasses I brought were the same ones I wore at seminars when I didn&#x2019;t want to be recognized. They were black, wraparound, military-grade Wiley X&#x2014;the same kind Bradley Cooper wore in the movie American Sniper.<br> <br>I lifted my backpack and walked west toward the hotel.<br> <br>I hoped to avoid my neighbors&#x2014;not that they would recognize me anyway. In the past seven years, I had only spoken to a few of them and that wasn&#x2019;t at any great length. I was on the road more than eight months out of the year, and when I was home it was usually after dark.<br> <br>Oak Park is a quiet bedroom community about ten miles west of Chicago. My home was just off North Oak Park Avenue on Erie Street, just a block south of Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s childhood home. I also lived less than a mile from Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s home and studio. His influence was profound in the area, as he had designed more than twenty-five structures in Oak Park. It&#x2019;s where he perfected his signature prairie style architecture that changed not only the Oak Park landscape but the very course of twentieth-century architecture.<br> <br>I felt conspicuous walking through the neighborhood with a backpack, but the sidewalks and asphalt were still puddled from the recent storm and my neighbors seemed content to stay inside.<br> <br>It took me just a little more than ten minutes to reach the hotel. The Write Inn is a four-story, redbrick structure with a large green awning shadowing the front entrance. It is a boutique hotel, small by any standard, just sixty-five rooms.<br> <br>As I walked into the hotel lobby, I saw a couple at the front counter. I walked up behind them to wait and was about to remove my sunglasses when the woman turned and looked at me. I knew her. I didn&#x2019;t remember how I knew her, but I did. She must have recognized me as well, or thought she did, as her gaze lingered longer than what is usually considered socially acceptable. With my hat and glasses on, I knew she couldn&#x2019;t have been certain. I casually looked away, pretending that I didn&#x2019;t notice her.<br> <br>Then she turned back to the man and took his arm and they stepped away from the counter. I let go of the breath I hadn&#x2019;t realized I was holding. But then the couple stopped again and stood talking by the door.<br> <br>The woman behind the desk looked up and asked, &#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d; She was close to my age, pale, with thick-rimmed, black-framed eyeglasses and curly black hair.<br> <br>I shrugged off my pack and laid it up against a column, took out my wallet, then glanced over to see if the couple had left. They hadn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Just a moment,&#x201d; I said softly, acting as if I was trying to find my ID.<br> <br>Then I remembered how I knew the woman. Kate. She had attended one of my seminars and had cornered me afterward. She had applied for a job as a presenter and was angry that I hadn&#x2019;t hired her. Crazy angry.<br> <br>Kate had called me sexist in front of a crowd of clients. Amanda had spoken before I could. &#x201c;Mr. James hires a lot of intelligent, talented women, which is precisely why you weren&#x2019;t hired.&#x201d; Kate had gone bright red, then turned and ran from the hall.<br> <br>Kate glanced back over at me once more, and then they walked out of the hotel. I breathed out in relief.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said to the clerk, extracting my credit card from my wallet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to check in.&#x201d; I handed her the card without speaking my name to draw less attention to it.<br> <br>She briefly looked down at my credit card, then at her computer screen. &#x201c;Mr. James.

The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, arguably one of the most popular magick books ever published, contains two secret apocrypha ascribed to Moses, perhaps pseudepigraphically. The book consists of a collection of texts,which claim to explain the magick Moses used to win the biblical magick contest with the Egyptian priest-magicians, part the Red Sea, and perform other miraculous feats. It includes instruction in the form of invocations, magick words, and seals for calling upon the angels to affect worldly ends, from the sublime (calling down a plague of locusts and frogs upon your enemy) to the mundane (getting more money). Many manuscripts and printed pamphlet versions circulated in Germany in the 1800s, and an English translation by Johann Scheible first appeared in New York in 1880 that had not been corrected or re-edited until now. In creating this restored, corrected edition, Joseph Peterson drew on Scheible&#39;s final edition of the text and his original sources. It will be of great interest to those who have suffered through prior editions and anyone looking for a traditional source of Western magick. * Used in various modern traditions of American folk magick, from Pennsylvania Dutch hexmeisters and contemporary eclectic magicians, to voodoo practioners and African American root workers. * Updated or fresh translations from original German, Latin, and Hebrew sources and restoration of censored or left out passages in earlier editions and 35 pages of text never before translated. * Describes the biblical magick ascribed to Moses and its application. * Extensively illustrated with over 100 magical seals, signs, and sigils.</p><p>Joseph Peterson studied religion and various languages at the University of Minnesota and has translated many esoteric and religious source works. He has amassed a large collection of photocopies and microfilms of rare occult tracts for comparative research from the British Museum and other libraries.

But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata&#x2019;s past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler&#x2019;s terror threatens her life and family&#x2014;even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.<br><br>For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines.

The sun was hot and the air still, and as she walked pensively behind them, the birds and insects were making a tremendous racket. Beata and her younger sister Brigitte had come to Geneva with their mother for the summer. Beata had just turned twenty, and her sister was three years younger. It had been thirteen months since the Great War had begun the previous summer, and this year her father had wanted them out of Germany for their holiday. It was late August 1915, and he had just spent a month there with them. Both of her brothers were in the army and had managed to get leave to join them for a week. Horst was twenty-three and a lieutenant at divisional headquarters in Munich. Ulm was a captain in the 105th Infantry Regiment, part of the Thirtieth Division, attached to the Fourth Army. He had just turned twenty-seven during the week he spent with them in Geneva.<br><br> It had been nothing short of a miracle to get the entire family together. With the war seeming to devour all the young men in Germany, Beata worried constantly now about her brothers, as did their mother. Her father kept telling her that it would be over soon, but what Beata heard when she listened to her father and brothers talk was very different. The men were far more aware of the bleak times ahead than were the women. Her mother never spoke of the war to her, and Brigitte was far more upset that there were hardly any handsome young men to flirt with. Ever since she had been a little girl, all Brigitte had ever talked about was getting married. She had recently fallen in love with one of Horst's friends from university, and Beata had a strong suspicion that her beautiful younger sister would be getting engaged that winter.<br><br> Beata had no such interests or intentions. She had always been the quiet one, studious and far more serious, and she was much more interested in her studies than in finding a young man. Her father always said she was the perfect daughter. Their only moment of dissent had been when she had insisted she wanted to go to university like her brothers, which her father said was foolish. Although he himself was serious and scholarly, he didn't think that that degree of education was necessary for a woman. He told her he felt sure that in a short time she would be married and tending to a husband and children. She didn't need to go to university, and he hadn't allowed it.<br><br> Beata's brothers and their friends were a lively lot, and her sister was pretty and flirtatious. Beata had always felt different from them, set apart by her quiet ways and passion for education. In a perfect world, she would have loved to be a teacher, but when she said it, her siblings always laughed at her. Brigitte said that only poor girls became schoolteachers or governesses, and her brothers added that only ugly ones even thought about it. They loved to tease her, although Beata was neither poor nor ugly. Her father owned and ran one of the most important banks in Cologne, where they lived. They had a large handsome house in the Fitzengraben district, and her mother Monika was well known in Cologne, not only for her beauty but for her elegant clothes and jewelry. Like Beata, she was a quiet woman. Monika had married Jacob Wittgenstein when she was seventeen, and had been happy with him in the twenty-eight years since then.<br><br> The marriage had been arranged by their respective families, and was a good one. At the time their union had been the merger of two considerable fortunes, and Jacob had enlarged theirs impressively since then. He ran the bank with an iron fist and was almost clairvoyant about the banking business. Not only was their future secure, but so were those of their heirs. Everything about the Wittgensteins was solid. The only unpredictable element in their life now was the same one worrying everyone these days. The war was a great concern to them, particularly to Monika, with two sons in the army. The time they had shared in Switzerland had been a comforting respite, for the parents as well as the children.<br><br> Ordinarily, they spent their summers in Germany, at the seashore, but this year Jacob had wanted to get them all out of Germany for July and August. He had even spoken to one of the commanding generals whom he knew well, and gently asked the enormous favor of having both of his sons on leave and able to join them. The general had quietly arranged it. The Wittgensteins were that great rarity, a Jewish family that enjoyed not only great wealth but also enormous power. Beata was aware of it but paid little attention to her family's importance. She was far more interested in her studies. And although Brigitte sometimes fretted over the constraints their orthodoxy put on them, Beata, in her own quiet way, was deeply religious, which pleased her father. As a young man, he had shocked his own family by saying that he wanted to be a rabbi. His father had talked sense into him, and at the appropriate time, he had joined the family bank, along with his father, brothers, uncles, and grandfather before them. Theirs was a family steeped in tradition, and although Jacob's father had a great respect for the rabbinical life, he had no intention of sacrificing his son to it. And like the obedient son he was, Jacob went to work at the bank, and married shortly thereafter. At fifty, he was five years older than Beata's mother.<br><br> The entire family agreed that the decision to summer in Switzerland this year had been a good one. The Wittgensteins had many friends here, and Jacob and Monika had attended a number of parties, as had their children. Jacob knew everyone in the Swiss banking community and had gone to Lausanne and Zurich to see friends in those cities as well. Whenever possible, they took the girls with them. While Horst and Ulm were there, they spent as much time as they could enjoying their company. Ulm was leaving for the front when he got back, and Horst was stationed at divisional headquarters in Munich, which he seemed to find vastly amusing. In spite of the serious upbringing he'd had, Horst was something of a playboy. He and Brigitte had much more in common with each other than either of them did with Beata.<br><br> As she fell behind the others, walking slowly along the lake, her oldest brother Ulm hung back and fell into step beside her. He was always protective of her, perhaps because he was seven years older. Beata knew he respected her gentle nature and loving ways.<br><br> "What are you thinking about, Bea? You look awfully serious walking along by yourself. Why don't you join us?"<br><br> Her mother and sister were far ahead by then, talking about fashion and the men Brigitte had found handsome at the previous week's parties. The men in the family were talking about the only subjects that interested them--which these days were the war and banking. After the war, Ulm was going back to work at the bank again, as he had for four years before. Their father said that Horst was going to have to stop playing, become serious, and join them. Horst had promised that as soon as the war was over, he would. He was only twenty-two when war was declared the year before, and he had assured his father that when the war was over, he'd be ready. And Jacob had said several times recently that it was time for Ulm to get married. The one thing Jacob expected of his children, or anyone in his immediate circle actually, was that they obey him. He expected that of his wife as well, and she had never disappointed him. Nor had his children, with the exception of Horst, who had been dragging his feet about working when he went into the army. The last thing on Horst's mind at the moment was marriage. In fact, the only one interested in that prospect was Brigitte. Beata hadn't met a man who had swept her off her feet yet. Although she thought that many of her parents' friends' sons were handsome, many of the young ones seemed silly, and the older ones frightened her a bit and often seemed too somber. She was in no hurry to be married. Beata often said that if she married anyone, she hoped he would be a scholar, and not necessarily a banker. There was no way she could say that to her father, although she had confessed it to her mother and sister many times. Brigitte said that sounded boring. The handsome young friend of Horst's she had her eye on was as frivolous as she was, and from an equally important banking family. Jacob was intending to meet with the boy's father in September to discuss it, although Brigitte didn't know that. But so far, no suitor had emerged for Beata, nor did she really want one. She rarely spoke to anyone at parties. She went dutifully with her parents, wearing the dresses her mother chose for her. She was always polite to their hosts, and immensely relieved when it was time to go home. Unlike Brigitte, who had to be dragged away, complaining that it had been far too early to leave the party, and why did her family have to be so dull and boring. Horst was in complete agreement with her, and always had been. Beata and Ulm were the serious ones.<br><br> "Have you had fun in Geneva?" Ulm asked Beata quietly. He was the only one who made a serious effort to speak to her, and find out what she was thinking. Horst and Brigitte were far too busy playing and having fun to spend time on more erudite subjects with their sister.<br><br> "Yes, I have." Beata smiled shyly up at him. Even though he was her brother, Beata was always dazzled by how handsome he was, and how kind. He was a gentle person, and looked exactly like their father. Ulm was tall and blond and athletic, as Jacob had been in his youth. Ulm had blue eyes and features that often confused people, because he didn't look Jewish. Everyone knew they were, of course, and in the social world of Cologne, they were accepted in even the most aristocratic circles. Several of the Hohenlohes, and Thurn und Thaxis were childhood friends of their father's. The Wittgensteins were so established and so respected that all doors were open to them. But Jacob had also made it clear to all his children that when the time came for them to marry, the spouses they brought home would be Jewish. It was not even a subject for discussion; nor would any of them even think to question it. They were accepted for who and what they were, and there were many eligible young men and women in their own circles for the Wittgenstein children to choose from. When the time came for them to marry, they would marry one of them.<br><br> Ulm and Beata didn't even look remotely related as they walked along the lake. Her brothers and sister looked exactly like their father, they were all tall blondes with blue eyes and fine features. Beata looked like their mother, in total contrast to them. Beata Wittgenstein was a tiny, frail-looking, delicate brunette, with raven-dark hair and skin the color of porcelain. The only feature she shared with the others was enormous blue eyes, although hers were darker than her brothers' or Brigitte's. Her mother's eyes were dark brown, but other than that minor difference, Beata was the image of her mother, which secretly delighted her father. He was still so much in love with his wife after nearly twenty-nine years that just seeing Beata smile at him reminded him of when her mother was the same age in the early years of their marriage, and the similarity never failed to touch his heart. As a result, he had an enormous soft spot for Beata, and Brigitte frequently complained that Beata was his favorite. He let her do whatever she wanted. But what Beata wanted was harmless. Brigitte's plans were considerably racier than her older sister's. Beata was content to stay home and read or study, in fact, she preferred it. The only time her father had actually gotten annoyed with her was on one occasion when Jacob found her reading a King James version of the Bible.<br><br> "What is that about?" he asked with a stern expression, as he saw what she was reading. She had been sixteen at the time and was fascinated by it. She had read quite a lot of the Old Testament before that.<br><br> "It's interesting, Papa. The stories are wonderful, and so many things in it are exactly what we believe." She preferred the New Testament to the Old. Her father found it less than amusing and had taken it away from her.<br><br> He didn't want his daughter reading a Christian Bible, and he had complained about it to her mother, and suggested that Monika keep a closer eye on what she was reading. In fact, Beata read everything she could get her hands on, including Aristotle and Plato. She was a voracious reader and loved the Greek philosophers. Even her father had to admit that if she had been a man, she would have been an extraordinary scholar. What he wanted for her now, as he did for Ulm and even for the other two sometime soon, was for her to get married. He was beginning to fear that she would become spinsterish and too serious if she waited much longer. He had a few ideas he wanted to explore in that vein that winter, but the war had disrupted everything. So many men were serving in the army, and many young people they knew had been killed in the past year. The uncertainty of the future was deeply disturbing.<br><br> Her father thought that Beata would do well with a man who was older than she was. He wanted a mature man for Beata, a man who could appreciate her intellect and share her interests. He wasn't opposed to that idea for Brigitte either, who could use a strong hand to control her. Although he loved all his children, he was extremely proud of his oldest daughter. He considered himself a man of wisdom and compassion. He was the kind of person others never hesitated to turn to. Beata had a deep love and respect for him, as she did for her mother, although she secretly admitted to the others that their mother was easier to talk to, and a little less daunting than their father. Their father was as serious as Beata, and often disapproved of his younger daughter's frivolity.</p><h2>Makoons (Birchbark House, 5)</h2><p><p><strong>In this award-winning sequel to <em>Chickadee</em>, acclaimed author Louise Erdrich continues her&nbsp;celebrated Birchbark House series with the story of an Ojibwe family in nineteenth-century America.</strong></p><p>Named for the Ojibwe word for little bear, Makoons and his twin, Chickadee, have traveled with their family to the Great Plains of Dakota Territory.</p><p>There they must learn to become buffalo hunters and once again help their people make a home in a new land.

A dragon embodied the yang, the masculine principle of life, and it was thought that if a couple expecting a child prayed to the dragon&#x2019;s egg, their offspring would be male. Of course, every family in those days desired a son over a daughter. Only men could carry on the family line; women were merely vessels by which to provide society with an uninterrupted supply of men. So every day for months before I was born, my parents would rise before dawn, carrying offerings of fresh-steamed rice cakes to the stone well behind our home, as the sky brightened and snuff ed out the stars. And they would pray to the pale freckled face of the moon floating on the water&#x2019;s surface, pray that the child growing inside my mother&#x2019;s womb would be a boy. <br>In this they were to be disappointed. On the third day of the First Moon in the Year of the Rooster, their first and only daughter was born to them. In those waning days of the Yi Dynasty, newborn girls were not deemed important enough to be graced with formal names, but were instead given nicknames. Often these represented some personal characteristic: Cheerful, Pretty, Little One, Big One. Sometimes they presumed to be commandments: Chastity, or Virtue. A few&#x2014;Golden Calf, Little Flower&#x2014; verged on the poetic. But too many names reflected the parents&#x2019; feelings about the birth of a daughter. I knew a girl named Anger, and another called Pity. More than a few were known as Sorrow or Sadness. And everyone had heard the story of the father who named his firstborn daughter &#x201c;One is Okay,&#x201d; his next, &#x201c;Perhaps After the Second,&#x201d; the third, &#x201c;Three Laughs,&#x201d; and the last, &#x201c;Four Shames.&#x201d; <br>As for me, my parents named me &#x201c;Regrettable&#x201d;&#x2014;eventually shortened to simply Regret. <br>Koreans seldom address one another by their given names; we believe a person&#x2019;s name is a thing of intimacy and power, not to be used casually by anyone but a family member or close friend. When I was very young, Regret was merely a name to me, signifying nothing more than that. But as I grew older and learned it held another meaning, it became a stone weight in my heart. A call to supper became a reminder of my unfortunate presence at the dinner table. A stern rebuke by my father&#x2014;&#x201c;Regret, what are we to do with you?&#x201d;&#x2014;seemed to hint that my place in the family was impermanent. Too young to understand the real reasons, I wondered what was wrong with me to make me so unwanted. Was I too short? I wasn&#x2019;t as tall as my friend Sunny, but not nearly so short as her sister Lotus. Was I too plain? I spent hours squinting into the mirror, judging my every feature, and found them wanting. My eyes were set too close together, my nose was too small, or maybe it was too big; my lips were thin, my ears flat. It was clear to see, I was plain and unlovely&#x2014;no wonder my parents regretted my birth. <br>In truth, my father was merely old-fashioned and conservative, a strict adherent to Confucian ideals, one of which was the inherent pre ce dence of man over woman: &#x201c;The wife must regard her husband as heavenly; what he does is a heavenly act and she can only follow him.&#x201d; I was a girl, I would eventually marry and become part of someone else&#x2019;s family; as such my existence was simply not of the same consequence as that of my three brothers, who would carry on the family line and provide for our parents when they became old. <br>But I knew none of this when I was young, and instead decided it was due to the shape of my nose or the color of my eyes; and for years to come I would fret over and find fault with the girl who looked back at me from the mirror. <br>I have traveled far from the land of my birth, and even farther from who I was then. More than forty years and four thousand miles separate us: the girl of sixteen who took that fi rst unwitting step forward, and the woman in her sixtieth year who now, in sight of the vast Pacific, presumes to memorialize this journey in mere words. It is a journey measured not in time or distance, but in the breadth of one&#x2019;s soul and the struggle of becoming. <br>Excerpted from Honolulu by Alan Brennert.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Alan Brennert.<br>Published in February 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

By the year 2030, experts estimate that as many as 66 million people around the world will be faced with this life-altering disease. Unfortunately, these staggering statistics&nbsp;impact millions of caregivers, too. Compared with all types of caregivers, those who assist someone with dementia experience the highest levels of burnout, depression, poor health, and premature death. <i>A Dignified Life, Revised and Expanded</i> offers hope and help with a proven approach.<br><br>Ten years ago, the first edition of <i>A Dignified Life</i> changed the way the caregiving community approached Alzheimer's disease by showing caregivers how to act as a Best Friend to the person, finding positive ways to interact even as mental abilities declined. Firmly grounded in the latest knowledge about the progression and treatment of dementia, this&nbsp;expanded&nbsp;edition offers a wealth of immediately usable tips and new problem-solving advice. It incorporates practical ideas for therapeutic activities&#x2014;including the latest brain-fitness exercises&#x2014;stimulate the brain while adding structure, meaning, and context to daily routines.&nbsp;With new stories and examples as well as an updated resources section, <i>A Dignified Life, Revised and Expanded</i> gives caregivers the support and advice they need to be successful and inspired in their demanding roles.<br><br>While medical treatment of the disease hasn't changed in the past ten years, our understanding and awareness of treating people in a more caring way has changed substantially. With no cure on the immediate horizon, respectful care by effective and compassionate care partners is the only real "treatment" available to people with dementia. The Best Friends&#x2122; Approach is successful because it sustains people's connection to their world, their loved ones, and themselves. It's a universal program which has been embraced by professional and family caregivers throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and South America. In its revised form, <i>A Dignified Life</i> offers caregivers an antidote to the burnout and frustration that often accompanies the role of caring for a person with Alzheimer's and dementia. Rather than struggling through a series of frustrations and failures, <i>A Dignified Life</i> shows the new generation care partners how to bring dignity, meaning, and peace of mind to the lives of both those who have Alzheimer's and dementia and those who care for them.</p><p>Virginia Bell, MSW, is Program Consultant for the Greater Kentucky/Southern Indiana Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association at the age of 90.

What would it be like to be unsure of your surroundings, to have difficulty communicating, to not recognize a once-familiar face, or to be unable to do things you have always enjoyed? When you understand the world of people with dementia, you can begin to understand their experiences, develop empathy, and relate better to their situations.</p> <p>The experience of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia can be like taking a trip to a foreign country where you don't speak the language. Customs are different. Deciphering a restaurant menu proves difficult; you may think you are ordering soup and end up with fish! When paying a restaurant bill with unfamiliar currency you might fear that you are being shortchanged, cheated. Tasks so easy at home are major challenges in an unfamiliar setting and can be exhausting. The person with dementia is in a foreign land all the time, as seen in Irene Hong's postcard.</p> <p><i>Hello Friends:</i></p> <p><i>Rural Taiwan is lush and green but I'm staying in the noisy city of Taipei in my grandmother's place who is 80 and sharp as a nail. One thing that might interest you is that when my Mom first came back to Taiwan after a 20 year absence, she was so disoriented that she surmised this might be what the initial stages of Alzheimer's is like. She couldn't find the right words in Taiwanese (her native language) and she'd forgotten some of the customs though everybody expected her to know her way around her 'home' country. She felt so frustrated. It is true that Alzheimer's disease is like traveling in a foreign country, isn't it?</i></p> <p><i>Irene Hong, volunteer, Postcard sent to Helping Hand Day Center</i></p> <p>Rebecca Riley was one of our early teachers about the experience of dementia. A nurse and educator, Rebecca was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at age 59. When she first began having difficulty teaching, she thought it was because the course content was new. Soon, she knew something was wrong with her thinking and memory, and she suspected that she might have Alzheimer's disease. Her physician later confirmed her suspicions. Rebecca taught us about the world of dementia. Following are some of her written notes describing her experience:</p> <p>� Depression</p> <p>� Can't say what I want</p> <p>� Afraid I can't express my thoughts and words&#x2015;thus I remain silent and become depressed</p> <p>� I need conversation to be slowly</p> <p>� It is difficult to follow conversation with so much noise</p> <p>� I feel that people turn me off because I cannot express myself</p> <p>� I dislike social workers, nurses, and friends who do not treat me as a real person</p> <p>� It is difficult to live one day at a time</p> <p>Rebecca knew that she was losing her language skills and the ability to communicate her wishes. Her writing reveals that her once-meticulous grammar was slipping. Complexity became her enemy; she could not follow the din and roar of competing conversations&#x2015;calling it 'noise.' Her statement about social workers, nurses, and friends who do not treat her as a 'real person' still makes us both smile and wince. Even though her cognitive skills were in decline, she recognized that people were treating her differently. -Consequently, she expressed her anger and some resentment toward these people. Remarkably, she was trying to create a plan for the future. Her notes indicate that she was deciding to take things 'one day at a time' even if it was a struggle.</p> <p>Reading these heartfelt words, you too can begin to understand the experience of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. Without understanding this world, we cannot possibly develop successful strategies for improving the lives of our friends or loved ones with dementia.</p> <p><b>Emotions That Accompany Alzheimer's Disease</b></p> <p>Persons with dementia commonly experience these emotions and feelings:</p> <p>� Worry and anxiety</p> <p>� Frustration</p> <p>� Confusion</p> <p>� Loss</p> <p>� Sadness</p> <p>� Embarrassment</p> <p>� Paranoia</p> <p>� Fear</p> <p>� Anger</p> <p>� Isolation and loneliness</p> <p><b>COMMON EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS OF PERSONS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER DEMENTIA</b></p> <p>Every person's response to Alzheimer's disease or other dementia is different, but many people will experience one or more of the following emotions.</p> <p><b>Worry and Anxiety</b></p> <p>We all worry or become anxious at times. Parents worry and become anxious about their teenager who is not home by curfew. Families may worry about having enough money to pay all of their bills at the end of the month. Some people worry that a favorite celebrity's marriage is in trouble after reading the latest tabloid at the supermarket.</p> <p>The person with dementia can become consumed by worry and anxiety. One frequent by-product of dementia is that the person cannot separate a small worry from an all-consuming concern. For example, a person with dementia may begin worrying about dark clouds in the sky seen through a window. Left unchecked, the worry can grow and wreck his or her afternoon. A spring shower could turn into a thunderstorm!</p> <p><i>Harry Nelson was a practicing dentist when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in his mid-fifties. He was very anxious about his life and the lives of his family. He worried, when in spite of his determination to keep fit mentally, spiritually, and physically, his scores on his mental exam kept going down. He worried that he would not be able to go hiking with his grandson when he became old enough to enjoy a sport that he loved. His dreams and aspirations were on hold, and he had difficulty not being anxious about the future.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>�2012. Virginia Bell, MSW and David Troxel, MPH. All rights reserved.

Coal smoke burst from the locomotive&#x2019;s stack in a drumstick plume that dusted the stars stippling the night sky. Inside the cab, the engineer slipped a silver Waltham watch from the pocket of his coveralls, sprung the lid and studied the face in the glow from the firebox. It was not the approaching storm that worried him, but the relentless crawl of time that sought to rob him of his precious schedule.<br><br>Gazing out the right side of the cab, he watched the creosote ties sweep under the eight huge driving wheels of the 2-8-0 Consolidation-type locomotive. Like the captain of a ship who lived with his command, he had been at the same throttle for three years. He was proud of &#x201c;Gallopin&#x2019; Lena,&#x201d; as he affectionately called the 236,000 pounds of iron and steel. Built by Alco&#x2019;s Schenectady Works in 1911, she was burnished in gloss black with a red stripe and her number 88 neatly hand-painted in gold.<br><br>He listened to the steel wheels pounding out a moving rhythm against the rail joints, felt the momentum of the locomotive and the seven cars that followed.<br><br>Then he pulled the throttle up another notch.<br>In the seventy-foot private Pullman that brought up the rear, Richard Essex sat at a desk in the vestibuled library. Too tired to sleep and bored with the tedium of the trip, he composed a letter to his wife to pass the time.<br><br>He described the ornate interior of the car, the elaborately carved Circassian walnut, the handsome brass electrical lamps, the red velvet revolving chairs and the potted palms. He even mentioned the beveled mirrors and ceramic tile floors in the lavatories of the four spacious sleeping compartments.<br><br>Behind him in a richly paneled observation parlor, five army guards in civilian dress played cards, the smoke from their cigars drifting in a blue cloud toward the brocade ceiling, their rifles laid casually about the furniture. Occasionally a player would lean over one of the brass spittoons dotting the Persian carpet. It was perhaps the highest level of luxury any of them had ever enjoyed, Essex speculated. The palatial transportation must have cost the government nearly seventy-five dollars a day, and all for the movement of a scrap of paper.<br><br>He sighed and finished his letter. Then he sealed it in an envelope, which he stuffed inside his breast pocket. Sleep still evaded him, so he sat and stared through the arched bay windows at the darkened landscape, listening for the wail of the engine&#x2019;s whistle just before a village depot or country crossing flashed past. Finally he stood up, stretched and walked to the elegant dining room, where he sat down at a mahogany table covered by a snowy cloth enhanced by crystal glasses and silver service. A glance at his watch told him it was a few minutes before two in the morning.<br><br>&#x201c;What is your pleasure, Mr. Essex?&#x201d; A black waiter had appeared as if by magic.<br><br>Essex looked up and smiled. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s quite late, but I wonder if I might get a light snack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Happy to oblige, sir. What would you like to order?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something that will help me close my eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>The waiter flashed a toothy grin. &#x201c;May I suggest a small bottle of Pommard burgundy and a nice hot bowl of clam bouillon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That will be fine, thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Later, as he sipped his wine, Essex couldn&#x2019;t help wondering if Harvey Shields was also finding sleep so elusive.<br><br><i>2</i><br>Harvey Shields was experiencing a nightmare.<br><br>His mind refused to accept any other explanation. The shriek of steel and the cries of agony and terror beyond the darkness that smothered him were too hellish for reality. He struggled to retreat from the devilish scene and drift back into a peaceful sleep, but then the pain began gnawing at his senses and he realized it was no dream.<br><br>Somewhere below he could hear the rush of water as though it was surging through a tunnel, followed by a gust of wind that squeezed the breath from his lungs. He tried to open his eyes, but the lids felt glued shut. He was not aware that his head and face were coated with blood. His body was gripped in an immovable fetal position against cold, ungiving metal. An acrid electrical smell stung his nostrils and combined with the increasing pain to prod him onto a higher plateau of consciousness.<br><br>He tried to move his arms and legs, but they refused to respond. A strange silence settled around him, broken only by the murmur of lapping water. He made another attempt at breaking clear of the unseen vise that clutched him. He took a great breath and then exerted every muscle in his limbs.<br><br>Suddenly an arm tore free and he gasped as a jagged piece of metal sliced his forearm. The agony swept him to complete awareness. He wiped the congealing wetness from his eyes and gazed about what had once been his stateroom aboard the Canadian luxury liner bound for England.<br><br>The large mahogany dresser was gone, as was the writing desk and the nightstand. Where the deck and starboard bulkhead should have been was a massive cavity, and across the twisted edge there was only the fog-shrouded darkness and the black water of the St. Lawrence River. It was as if he was looking into a bottomless void. Then his eyes caught and focused on a soft reflection of white and he knew he was not alone.<br><br>Almost within touching distance a young girl from the next stateroom was buried in the debris with only her head and one pale shoulder protruding from the broken ceiling. Her hair was golden and rained in loose strands nearly three feet long. Her head was twisted at a grotesque angle and blood seeped from her lips, streaming down her face and slowly dyeing her cascading hair crimson.<br><br>Shields&#x2019; initial shock receded and a spreading sickness took its place. Until now the specter of death had not crossed his mind, but in the lifeless corpse of the girl he could read his own diminishing future. Then a sudden thought burst inside him.<br><br>In despair his eyes vainly probed the debris for the hand case he had never let out of his sight. It was gone, swallowed up in the wreckage. Sweat erupted from his every pore as he fought to extricate his torso from its prison. The effort was fruitless, there was no feeling below his chest and he knew with fearful certainty that his back was crushed.<br><br>Around him the great liner was in its death throes, rapidly listing and settling into the cold water that would forever be its grave. Passengers, some in evening dress, most in sleeping clothes, were milling about the slanting decks trying to climb into the few lifeboats that were launched or leaping into the cold river, clutching anything that would float. Only minutes remained before the ship would take her final plunge a scant two miles from shore.<br><br>&#x201c;Martha?&#x201d;<br><br>Shields stiffened and turned his head toward the faint cry that sounded from beyond the demolished partition separating him from the inside corridor. He listened intently, and then it came again.<br><br>&#x201c;Martha?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In here,&#x201d; Shields shouted. &#x201c;Please help me.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no reply, but he heard sounds of movement through the pile of rubble. Soon a fallen piece of the ceiling was pushed aside and a face with a gray beard poked through.<br><br>&#x201c;My Martha, have you seen my Martha?&#x201d;<br><br>The intruder was in a state of shock and his words came hollow and without inflection. His forehead was badly lacerated and his eyes darted about frantically.<br><br>&#x201c;A young girl with long blond hair?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, my daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>Shields motioned toward the body of the girl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid she&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>The bearded man feverishly forced a larger opening and crawled through. He approached the girl, his face numb with uncomprehension, and lifted the bloodstained head, smoothing back the hair. For several moments he did not utter a sound.<br><br>&#x201c;She did not suffer,&#x201d; Shields offered gently.<br><br>The stranger did not reply.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Shields murmured. He could feel the ship listing sharply to starboard. The water was rising faster from below and there was little time left. He had to penetrate the father&#x2019;s grief and somehow persuade him to rescue the hand case.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what happened?&#x201d; he began.<br><br>&#x201c;Collision,&#x201d; the answer came vaguely. &#x201c;I was on deck. Another ship came out of the fog. Buried her bow in our side.&#x201d; The father paused, took out a handkerchief and dabbed the blood from the dead girl&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Martha begged me to take her to England. Her mother was reluctant, but I gave in. Oh God, if only I&#x2019;d known . . .&#x201d; His voice trailed off.<br><br>&#x201c;There is nothing you can do,&#x201d; Shields said. &#x201c;You must save yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>The father turned slowly and looked at him with unseeing eyes. &#x201c;I killed her,&#x201d; he whispered hoarsely.<br><br>Shields was not getting through. Anger smoldered within him and ignited in a flame of desperation.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Lost in the wreckage is a travel case with a document that must reach the Foreign Office in London!&#x201d; He was shouting now. &#x201c;Please find it!&#x201d;<br><br>The water swirled in small eddies a few feet away. The flood that would engulf them was only seconds away. The rising tide was stained with the slime of oil and coal dust while the night air outside was torn by the screams of a thousand dying souls.<br><br>&#x201c;Please listen to me while there is still time,&#x201d; Shields begged.<br><br>&#x201c;Your daughter is dead.&#x201d; He was beating at the restricting steel with clenched fists, uncaring of the pain as his skin shredded away. &#x201c;Leave before it&#x2019;s too late. Find my travel case and take it with you. Give it to the captain, he&#x2019;ll know what to do.&#x201d;<br><br>The father&#x2019;s mouth trembled open. &#x201c;I cannot leave Martha alone . . . she fears the dark . . .&#x201d; He muttered as though he were speaking at an altar.<br><br>It was the deathblow. There was no moving the grief-stunned father as his mind entered delirium. He bent over his daughter and kissed her on the forehead. Then he dissolved into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.<br><br>Strangely, the fury of frustration fell away from Shields.

In <i>Guts</i>, Gary tells the real stories behind the Brian books, the stories of the adventures that inspired him to write Brian Robeson's story: working as an emergency volunteer; the death that inspired the pilot's death in <i>Hatchet</i>; plane crashes he has seen and near-misses of his own. He describes how he made his own bows and arrows, and takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes. He shares special memories, such as the night he attracted every mosquito in the county, or how he met the moose with a sense of humor, and the moose who made it personal. There's a handy chapter on "Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition." Recipes included. Readers may wonder how Gary Paulsen survived to write all of his books -- well, it took guts.</p><p>What do you do when you're being charged by a red-eyed furious wall of brown fur that is an insane moose? How do you make a weapon with your bare hands? How do you sneak up on a grouse or a rabbit, kill it with a well-aimed arrow, and cook it over a fire--without a pot? All this and lots more is essential learning for Brian Robeson, the young wilderness survivor in Gary Paulsen's classic novel <i>Hatchet</i>. In writing that book, Paulsen was determined that everything that happened to Brian--the survival techniques and the physical and emotional traumas--would be drawn closely from reality and his own experiences. In <i>Guts</i> he reveals the stories behind <i>Hatchet</i>, as he lived them. Linked to specific incidents from Brian's ordeal are the skills and insights Paulsen learned as a teenager passionately in love with hunting in the north woods of Minnesota, the extremes of exhaustion and cold he knew in running the Iditarod dog races in Alaska, the chilling close-up knowledge of heart attacks from his experiences as a volunteer ambulance driver, the silence and majesty of the wilderness. Some great stories are told here: the child killed by two kicks from the razor-sharp hooves of a small deer, the difficulties of sharing a rescue helicopter ride with a terrified dog team, and some spectacular gross-outs about the nutritional need to eat every part of an animal. <i>Hatchet</i> fans will be agog, and parents and teachers will be thrilled to see the enthusiastic reaction of even the most reluctant readers.

These two masterworks are joined here by Sean Wilentz's selection of Hofstadter's most trenchant uncollected writings of the postwar period: discussions of the Constitution's framers, the personality and legacy of FDR, higher education and its discontents, the relationship of fundamentalism to right-wing politics, and the advent of the modern conservative movement.</p><p><b>Richard Hofstadter</b> (1916-1970) was the author of many classic and bestselling works of American history, among them <i>Social Darwinism in American Thought </i>(1944), <i>The American Political Tradition: And the Men Who Made It</i> (1948), <i>The Age of Reform </i>(1955), and <i>America at 1750: A Social Portrait </i>(1971).

If you need to fit homesteading into a few hours each weekend and would like to have fun while doing it, these projects will be right up your alley, whether you live on a forty-acre farm, a postage-stamp lawn in suburbia, or a high rise. <br><br>Permaculture techniques will turn your homestead into a vibrant ecosystem and attract native pollinators while converting our society's waste into high-quality compost and mulch. Meanwhile, enjoy the fruits of your labor right away as you learn the basics of cooking and eating seasonally, then preserve homegrown produce for later by drying, canning, freezing, or simply filling your kitchen cabinets with storage vegetables.<br><br>As you become more self-sufficient, you'll save seeds, prepare for power outages, and tear yourself away from a full-time job, while building a supportive and like-minded community. You won't be completely eliminating your reliance on the grocery store, but you will be plucking low-hanging (and delicious!) fruits out of your own garden by the time all forty-eight projects are complete.</p><p><b>Anna Hess</b> is a homesteader, writer, and blogger whose first book, <i>The Weekend Homesteader</i>, helped thousands of homesteaders-to-be find ways to fit their dreams into the hours leftover from a full-time job.&#x201c;As food self-sufficiency awareness grows, books appear to support such efforts. Hess is unique in her recognition of the practicality of weekend-only attention to these pursuits. A 12-month structure helps a variety of readers, from multiacre farm dwellers to suburbanites and high-rise residents, start with short projects. Springtime planning includes acreage, backyard and urban container plantings, rooftop and community gardens via mapping, record-keeping, and planting tips (okra, squash). Hess segues to summer and fall plantings (leaf lettuce, turnips, carrots), advising on seed and food preservation and season-extension using hoop-supported protection. Colder weather means planning crop rotation, soil testing, and planting fruit trees and berries, and March allows the planting of cold-tolerant veggies (beets, onions).

In <em>Finishing Our Course with Joy</em>, renowned theologian and author J. I. Packer challenges us to embrace old age as an opportunity for continued learning, careful planning, and heartfelt discipleship. Packer&#x2019;s pastoral words and personal stories encourage us to press on toward the upward call of God with endurance and grace&#x2015;that we might continue to glorify God in our aging and finish our lives with joy.</p></p><p><p><strong>J.

If I had, perhaps I wouldn&#x2019;t need wisdom from J. I. Packer. But I didn&#x2019;t, and therefore I do! And what wonderful wisdom it is, the sort that challenges us, redirects our energy, and equips us with biblical truth to face our latter years. I&#x2019;m at that stage in life where &#x2018;engaging&#x2019; with my &#x2018;aging&#x2019; has become increasingly more urgent. And I can&#x2019;t think of anyone who can provide more helpful and encouraging insight than J. I. Packer. Don&#x2019;t wait until you&#x2019;re sixty or seventy to read this book.

It is more important than ever to have a biblical mind about how we spend our latter years for God&#x2019;s glory. We want to finish well (2 Tim. 4:7). And good pastors care to prepare their people to do precisely this. <em>Finishing Our Course with Joy</em> comes as wise, true, timely, and edifying biblical reflection and pastoral counsel on this significant subject. Dr. Packer&#x2019;s book speaks to senior adults, those who love and care for them, those who will become them, and those who pastor them. As one who has had the privilege of knowing J. I. Packer since my teen years, reading these words&#x2015;written from his own personal experience, communion with God, and knowledge of the Word&#x2015;is poignant for me, to say the least.

But today the situation has grown even more dire. From the murders of black youth by the police, to the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act, to the disaster visited upon poor and middle-class black families by the Great Recession, it is clear that black America faces an emergency&#x2014;at the very moment the election of the first black president has prompted many to believe we&#x2019;ve solved America&#x2019;s race problem.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Democracy in Black</i> is Eddie S. Glaude Jr.'s impassioned response. Part manifesto, part history, part memoir, it argues that we live in a country founded on a &#x201c;value gap&#x201d;&#x2014;with white lives valued more than others&#x2014;that still distorts our politics today. Whether discussing why all Americans have racial habits that reinforce inequality, why black politics based on the civil-rights era have reached a dead end, or why only remaking democracy from the ground up can bring real change, Glaude crystallizes the untenable position of black America--and offers thoughts on a better way forward. Forceful in ideas and unsettling in its candor, <i>Democracy In Black </i>is a landmark book on race in America, one that promises to spark wide discussion as we move toward the end of our first black presidency.</p><p><b>EDDIE S. GLAUDE JR.</b> is a professor at Princeton University, teaching in the religion department and the Department of African American Studies.<p>Chapter One&nbsp;</p><p>The Great Black Depression</p><p>Christine Frazer cried softly. She had been through hell and back and the wounds had not healed. Chris had worked hard all her life. She and her late husband had dreamed big dreams for themselves and their family. They had played by the rules. But when Chris lost her home to foreclosure in 2012 everything changed. Now, at the age of sixty-five, she was out of work and forced to live in a senior facility, her cherished home gone, her health deteriorating, and her dreams shattered.</p><p>&#x201c;Me and my husband had a business for twenty-five years,&#x201d; she said in disbelief. &#x201c;I raised my daughter in that home. I wasn&#x2019;t a new homeowner. I had been there for eighteen years.&#x201d;</p><p>Before the eviction, Chris had lived with her eighty-five-year-old mother, her adult daughter, and her four-year-old grandson in a triplex home in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. The upstairs had three bedrooms, two baths, and two big living rooms. There were two separate apartments downstairs. The house sat on a large plot of land, with lots of open space where Chris&#x2019;s dog, Sheeba, could run around. A minister who was a little person had designed the house. &#x201c;He had been an architect, I guess. And there was not a square room in that house, the way he designed it. That&#x2019;s why I fell in love with it.&#x201d; Within a year of moving into their home, her husband lost his legs because of diabetes and had to use a wheelchair. &#x201c;But here&#x2019;s the kicker,&#x201d; Chris said. &#x201c;Since the house had been built for a dwarf, once the ramp was built, he could maneuver in that house just like anybody else because the switches were lower. It was like God sent us there.&#x201d;</p><p>But when Chris lost her job in 2009 she struggled to keep making the payments. The house was underwater. She had already paid $240,000 on a home now valued at $40,000. Her mortgage changed hands at least three times in six months. Chris tried everything to prevent foreclosure, but the latest holder of her loan--Investors One Corporation--decided to evict her. President Obama had created a plan to help distressed borrowers, but Chris couldn&#x2019;t take advantage of it; the program required that homeowners be current on their mortgage, and she was not. &#x201c;But if you&#x2019;re current on your mortgage, you don&#x2019;t need modification,&#x201d; Chris said. The game seemed rigged to protect the mortgage lenders.</p><p>Dekalb County sheriffs and deputies arrived in the middle of the night on May 2, 2012, to evict her. &#x201c;They came in like I was a dope dealer. At three in the morning they drilled a hole in the lock in my front door. They drilled out the lock and just came in my house. It was the most terrifying moment that I can remember in my life. My grandson is six years old, and to this day he does not like police officers, because he remembers. He remembers.&#x201d;</p><p>When the police stormed into the house they ordered Chris and her family to get dressed immediately. Then they proceeded to empty the home of a life&#x2019;s worth of memories. It was chaos. For seven hours the police piled Chris&#x2019;s things onto the street. No one could help. The police had cordoned off the area. &#x201c;They told me to pack up as if I just had a fire at my home and take my immediate possessions. And I had to leave immediately,&#x201d; she remembered. Everything was scattered, without any care, across the lawn. With no place to go, the family slept in the car--except for the family dog. The police made provisions for Sheeba.</p><p>&#x201c;That was the part that I think came out in the eviction. When they came for me at three in the morning, they didn&#x2019;t have a place for me and my family to go, but the animal shelter came because they knew that there were dogs there. They came with a place for my dog.&#x201d;</p><p>The sprawling metropolis of Atlanta sat at the epicenter of the housing crisis that shook the foundations of the American economy. Once considered a promised land where good-paying jobs and affordable living offered a real chance for people to fulfill their dreams, by 2012, Atlanta was a wasteland of foreclosed homes and skyrocketing unemployment. In 2007 black unemployment in greater Atlanta was 8.3 percent, but by 2010, that figure had nearly doubled. Chris was among the casualties. According to the Federal Reserve, Atlanta held the dubious distinction of having &#x201c;the most government-owned foreclosed properties for sale of any large city.&#x201d; The hard reality was undeniable, and Chris was just one example among many: the housing crisis was devastating black Atlanta, and it hardly stopped there. Like an out-of-control wildfire spreading across dry brushland, the crisis engulfed black America.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be like this.</p><p>The road to the housing crisis in black America was paved with good intentions, sort of. In June of 2002 President George W. Bush made his way to the pulpit of a quaint African Methodist Episcopal church in Atlanta. &#x201c;Now, we&#x2019;ve got a problem here in America that we have to address,&#x201d; he told the crowd.</p><p>Too many American families, too many minorities do not own a home. There is a home ownership gap in America. The difference between Anglo American and African American and Hispanic home ownership is too big. And we&#x2019;ve got to focus the attention of this nation to address this.</p><p>Bush had come to St. Paul AME to announce his plans for an &#x201c;ownership society.&#x201d; By 2010, he wanted to increase homeownership among minorities by at least 5.5 million. This required making it easier for low-income buyers to make a down payment; it meant that more affordable housing needed to be available in certain neighborhoods and involved streamlining the home-buying process.</p><p>Bush hoped to achieve his goal through a vast network of public-private partnerships. He announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would &#x201c;increase their commitment to minority markets by more than $440 billion.&#x201d; Freddie Mac would make it possible for &#x201c;consumers with poor credit . . . to get a mortgage with an interest rate that automatically goes down after a period of consistent payments&#x201d;; Fannie Mae would partner with 100 faith-based organizations to improve homeownership education, and organizations like the Enterprise Foundation would help rebuild and rehabilitate urban neighborhoods in partnership with local community groups.</p><p>The congregation lavished the president with applause. It was a surreal moment. Here was the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world--a Republican--stating unequivocally that he was committed to the idea that people of color should own something.</p><p>Before delivering the speech, President Bush toured Park Place South, a new development of affordable housing in an area once marked by crime and urban blight. There, he met Darrin West, a black Atlanta police officer who proudly showed off his new home. The president held up West as an example of what was possible with the policies he was promoting. And Bush&#x2019;s initial efforts to increase homeownership among African Americans were indeed quite successful. The rate of black homeownership rose to 49.1 percent during the height of the housing boom.</p><p>But the initiatives President Bush outlined in Atlanta unleashed torrid forces seeking to exploit &#x201c;emerging markets.&#x201d; According to the Center for Responsible Lending, African Americans were 150 percent more likely to get a high-cost loan with low interest rates that adjusted upward after two or three years. From 2007 to 2009, the African American homeownership rate fell by 6 percent (to the lowest level since 1995), a drop more than twice that experienced by any other racial group in the United States. African Americans lost more than 240,000 homes</p><p>One of them was Darrin West. He couldn&#x2019;t sell his home, so he gave it back to the bank and simply walked away. <i>The New York Times</i> reported that by 2008, &#x201c;at least 10 percent of [the] 232 homes&#x201d; in West&#x2019;s Park Place South development had been hit with foreclosure. This pattern played itself out across black America, as billions of dollars disappeared from communities already strapped for resources.</p><p>The irony is obvious and biting. So many Americans reveled in the historic significance of Barack Obama&#x2019;s election in 2008. There was a sense of real, exciting possibility, even as the nation confronted the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It was a moment of contrasts, of decline but also of possibility--that somehow we were putting the ugliness of our racial past behind us as the country teetered on economic collapse. Uncertainty shadowed national euphoria, and this was especially true for African Americans. Many danced election night away and talked about the fulfillment of the civil rights movement, then woke up to foreclosure notices on their doors.</p><p>The foreclosure crisis among African Americans gives a clear sense of the despair and devastation wrought by what can only be called the Great Black Depression. The 2008 recession threatened the economic foundations of the country; over and over again we heard from economists and pundits that the nation had not experienced anything like this since the Great Depression. Venerable financial institutions collapsed. Liquidity froze. Jobs disappeared overnight. The recession cast a dark economic shadow over America.</p><p>But in black America, the reality was even bleaker. I mean this beyond the familiar platitude that says &#x201c;whenever white America has a cold, black America has the flu.&#x201d; The reality is that by every relevant statistical measure (employment, wages, wealth, etc.) black America has experienced and is experiencing a depression. This is more like the symptoms of a national congenital disease than the flu.</p><p>To be sure, the circumstances of black America have waxed and waned since the heyday of the civil rights movement. The black freedom struggle of the 1960s brought unprecedented improvement in the lives of most African Americans. But even with these gains, the gap between whites and blacks persisted through the 1970s and 1980s alongside brewing racial tensions (often because of police violence) and deepening class divisions within black America. Combined with cyclical economic booms and busts, the slow march from the end of Jim Crow to full equality felt more like a bad roller-coaster ride. It was not until the long recovery of the 1990s, spurred by governmental policy and strong economic growth, that we began to see significant economic improvements for black America&#x2014;particularly for the black middle class.</p><p>Fast-forward to the Great Black Depression of 2008. Much of the gains of the 1990s were erased. African Americans lost 31 percent of their wealth between 2007 and 2010. White Americans lost 11 percent. By 2009, 35 percent of African American households had zero or negative net worth. According to the Pew Research Center, by 2011, black families had lost 53 percent of their wealth. Just think about it: an entire decade of economic gains wiped away. Gone. This wasn&#x2019;t just the loss of homes--the primary source of wealth for most African Americans--but lost retirement savings, which shrank by 35 percent from 2007 to 2010. As many struggled to save their homes, as they witnessed the stock market spiral downward and their pensions dwindle to nothing, they took out what little money they had invested in order to keep themselves afloat. Many could not wait for the market to rebound to reap its benefits. Their children won&#x2019;t be able to either.</p><p>As they lost their homes and saw their savings wiped out, people also lost their jobs, making it hard to imagine ever clawing their way back to where they&#x2019;d once been. Often the last hired and first fired, people saw black unemployment soar as a result of the economic collapse. So much so that by November 2010, national black unemployment reached the stunning level of 16 percent (and this figure does not include those who simply dropped out of the labor market). White unemployment stood at 9 percent. Some cities, including Detroit and New York, reported unemployment among black males at close to 50 percent.</p><p>For all these reasons, poverty is growing in black America. One out of four African Americans lives in poverty today. One out of three black children grows up in poverty, while only one out of ten white children lives in poverty. One out of five black children is growing up in extreme poverty. That child&#x2019;s parents make less than $11,746 a year for a family of four. They live on $979 a month, $226 a week, or what ends up being $32 a day. In twenty-five of the fifty states and in the District of Columbia, at least 40 percent of African American children are poor. This is galling for a nation that considers itself the leader of the free world and a pioneer of democratic principles.</p><p>Given the impact on African American children, this crisis is not only an event of the present. Its implications for future generations of African Americans have yet to be calculated. Chris Frazer&#x2019;s six-year-old grandson will remember the horror of police tossing his family&#x2019;s possessions out in the yard like garbage as they were evicted, but beyond those memories, what will he inherit? Like so many young African Americans in this country, he will have to start economically with little or no help from the previous generation, because social and systemic barriers have severely limited economic mobility for black folk; the Great Black Depression took the one thing his grandmother could claim as her own. His financial inheritance will be a balance of broken promises.</p><p>Such crushing poverty dashes the dreams of millions of children daily. But not only that: it almost ensures that they will lead less healthy lives as they grow up; that they will more than likely drop out of high school; that they will experience some form of violence in their lifetime; that they will likely find themselves caught up in the criminal justice system; and that they will end up raising their children in the same horrifying conditions they grew up in. In short, the terrible effects of the Great Black Depression guarantee, unless we fully understand the urgency of now, that even darker days are ahead.</p><p>The very foundations of black America have cracked under the weight of the economic fallout. It has affected what we own, how we work, and the future of our children. But what&#x2019;s really scary is how little anyone outside black America seems to care.</p><p>Patricia Hill was defiant. A judge had given her 75 days to vacate her beautiful home in the historic Bronzeville section of Chicago. In 2003 she&#x2019;d obtained a lower fixed-rate mortgage with the intent of using the savings for extensive home repairs. Five years later Patricia noticed that her mortgage payment had increased by $500. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t nobody afford $500 extra a month,&#x201d; she complained. Saxon Mortgage Services said it would correct the mistake. She continued to pay her regular mortgage, only to be told later that her account was in arrears. Patricia was caught in the spider&#x2019;s web of predatory lending.</p></p><h2>Sort it Out! (Arbordale Collection)</h2><p><b>Children's Choice Award-finalist</b><br> Packy the Packrat's mother has had enough! It s time that he sorts through his ever-growing collection of trinkets and puts them away. Told in rhyme, the text leads the reader to participate in the sorting process by categorizing Packy's piles of things according to like characteristics and attributes. The reader response is worked into the rhyme, building a sense of anticipation. The illustrations include a humorous subplot about Packy s sister, who enjoys pilfering some of his things for her own enjoyment. Children will relate to the idea of having a collection of favorite objects and the satisfaction that comes from examining and admiring these collectibles. The story promotes and reinforces analogous thinking a critical thinking skill in math, science, and life. In the supplemental activity section at the back of the book, the reader can explore even more attributes and characteristics of objects, including color, size, texture, shape, and material. Lexile code: NP.</p><p>Barbara Mariconda is one of those people who has done it all! An educator (K-6), a mentor teacher, an adjunct professor of Children s Literature and Process Writing, Barbara has also written a wide variety of musicals, songs, and books. She has worked with Children s Television Workshop and Cherry Lane music on the creative staff of the Sesame Street Music Magazine. In addition to writing workbooks and beginning readers, her middle grade novel, Turn the Cup Around, was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award for best children s mystery. She has also published numerous professional books for teachers, frequently speaks on the topic of writing for and with children, and provides professional development for teachers at seminars across the country. She is a partner in the educational seminar/consulting firm, Empowering Writers, LLC., and is a member of SCBWI. Barbara understands that sorting and categorizing, so clearly recognized as a math and science skill, also powerfully relates to writing. In order to write in an organized fashion, to group like details with broader main ideas, to recognize the ways in which main ideas in a piece of writing may overlap and therefore encourage redundancy, it all comes down to the writer s ability to think critically and sort things out. Barbara s huge collections of sea glass, pottery shards, glass paperweights, nutcrackers, wine bottle corks, and cowboy boots, all artfully sorted and arranged, served as the inspiration for this book.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;When Pack rat comes home with a cart full of stuff&#x2014;a locket, a book, an umbrella, a pinecone, and many more random items&#x2014;his mother admonishes him to sort it all out and put it away. Packy does just that, cleverly sorting things with like characteristics such as where they're found, their color, shape, etc. Children who like to collect may be inspired to bring some order to their own assortments. The illustrations are brightly colored, large, and very clear. Careful readers will notice a subplot in the pictures and find satisfaction in seeing its resolution on the final page. In addition, the rhyming text prompts them to guess the word that defines each collection. Back matter has activities to extend the experience. Most collections would benefit from this simple entry into the world of mathematics.&#x2014;<i>Linda M.

Now, this middle class is shrinking, a new oligarchy is rising, and the country faces its greatest wealth disparity in eighty years. Why is the economic system that made America strong suddenly failing us, and how can it be fixed? <br><br>Leading political economist and bestselling author Robert B. Reich presents a paradigm-shifting, clear-eyed examination of a political and economic status quo that no longer serves the people, exposing one of the most pernicious obstructions to progress today: the enduring myth of the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; when, behind the curtain, it is the powerful alliances between Washington and Wall Street that control the invisible hand. Laying to rest the specious dichotomy between a free market and &#x201c;big government,&#x201d; Reich shows that the truly critical choice ahead is between a market organized for broad-based prosperity and one designed to deliver ever more gains to the top. Visionary and acute, <i>Saving Capitalism </i>illuminates the path toward restoring America&#x2019;s fundamental promise of opportunity and advancement.</p><p><b>Robert B.

Someone introduces me and then introduces a person who is there to debate me. My debate opponent and I then spend five or ten minutes sparring over the chosen topic&#x2014;�education, poverty, income inequality, taxes, executive pay, middle-�class wages, climate change, drug trafficking, whatever. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Because, with astounding regularity, the debate soon turns to whether the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; is better at doing something than government.<br><br>I do not invite this. In fact, as I&#x2019;ve already said and will soon explain, I view it as a meaningless debate. Worse, it&#x2019;s a distraction from what we should be debating. Intentional or not, it deflects the public&#x2019;s attention from what&#x2019;s really at issue.<br><br>Few ideas have more profoundly poisoned the minds of more people than the notion of a &#x201c;free market&#x201d; existing somewhere in the universe, into which government &#x201c;intrudes.&#x201d; In this view, whatever inequality or insecurity the market generates is assumed to be the natural and inevitable consequence of impersonal &#x201c;market forces.&#x201d; What you&#x2019;re paid is simply a measure of what you&#x2019;re worth in the market. If you aren&#x2019;t paid enough to live on, so be it. If others rake in billions, they must be worth it. If millions of people are unemployed or their paychecks are shrinking or they have to work two or three jobs and have no idea what they&#x2019;ll be earning next month or even next week, that&#x2019;s unfortunate but it&#x2019;s the outcome of &#x201c;market forces.&#x201d;<br><br>According to this view, whatever we might do to reduce inequality or economic insecurity&#x2014;�to make the economy work for most of us&#x2014;�runs the risk of distorting the market and causing it to be less efficient, or of producing unintended consequences that may end up harming us. Although market imperfections such as pollution or unsafe workplaces, or the need for public goods such as basic research or even aid to the poor, may require the government to intervene on occasion, these instances are exceptions to the general rule that the market knows best.<br><br>The prevailing view is so dominant that it is now almost taken for granted. It is taught in almost every course on introductory economics. It has found its way into everyday public discourse. One hears it expressed by politicians on both sides of the aisle.<br><br>The question typically left to debate is how much intervention is warranted. Conservatives want a smaller government and less intervention; liberals want a larger and more activist government. This has become the interminable debate, the bone of contention that splits left from right in America and in much of the rest of the capitalist world. One&#x2019;s response to it typically depends on which you trust most (the least): the government or the &#x201c;free market.&#x201d;<br><br>But the prevailing view, as well as the debate it has spawned, is utterly false. There can be no &#x201c;free market&#x201d; without government. The &#x201c;free market&#x201d; does not exist in the wilds beyond the reach of civilization. Competition in the wild is a contest for survival in which the largest and strongest typically win. Civilization, by contrast, is defined by rules; rules create markets, and governments generate the rules. As the seventeenth-�century political philosopher Thomas Hobbes put it in his book Leviathan:<br><br>[in nature] there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.<br><br>A market&#x2014;�any market&#x2014;�requires that government make and enforce the rules of the game. In most modern democracies, such rules emanate from legislatures, administrative agencies, and courts. Government doesn&#x2019;t &#x201c;intrude&#x201d; on the &#x201c;free market.&#x201d; It creates the market.<br><br>The rules are neither neutral nor universal, and they are not permanent. Different societies at different times have adopted different versions. The rules partly mirror a society&#x2019;s evolving norms and values but also reflect who in society has the most power to make or influence them. Yet the interminable debate over whether the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; is better than &#x201c;government&#x201d; makes it impossible for us to examine who exercises this power, how they benefit from doing so, and whether such rules need to be altered so that more people benefit from them.<br><br>The size of government is not unimportant, but the rules for how the free market functions have far greater impact on an economy and a society. Surely it is useful to debate how much government should tax and spend, regulate and subsidize. Yet these issues are at the margin of the economy, while the rules are the economy. It is impossible to have a market system without such rules and without the choices that lie behind them. As the economic historian Karl Polanyi recognized, those who argue for &#x201c;less government&#x201d; are really arguing for a different government&#x2014;�often one that favors them or their patrons. &#x201c;Deregulation&#x201d; of the financial sector in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, for example, could more appropriately be described as &#x201c;reregulation.&#x201d; It did not mean less government. It meant a different set of rules, initially allowing Wall Street to speculate on a wide assortment of risky but lucrative bets and permitting banks to push mortgages onto people who couldn&#x2019;t afford them. When the bubble burst in 2008, the government issued rules to protect the assets of the largest banks, subsidize them so they would not go under, and induce them to acquire weaker banks. At the same time, the government enforced other rules that caused millions of people to lose their homes. These were followed by additional rules intended to prevent the banks from engaging in new rounds of risky behavior (although in the view of many experts, these new rules are inadequate).<br><br>The critical things to watch out for aren&#x2019;t the rare big events, such as the 2008 bailout of the Street itself, but the ongoing multitude of small rule changes that continuously alter the economic game. Even a big event&#x2019;s most important effects are on how the game is played differently thereafter. The bailout of Wall Street created an implicit guarantee that the government would subsidize the biggest banks if they ever got into trouble. This, as I will show, gave the biggest banks a financial advantage over smaller banks and fueled their subsequent growth and dominance over the entire financial sector, which enhanced their subsequent political power to get rules they wanted and avoid those they did not.<br><br>The &#x201c;free market&#x201d; is a myth that prevents us from examining these rule changes and asking whom they serve. The myth is therefore highly useful to those who do not wish such an examination to be undertaken. It is no accident that those with disproportionate influence over these rules, who are the largest beneficiaries of how the rules have been designed and adapted, are also among the most vehement supporters of the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; and the most ardent advocates of the relative superiority of the market over government. But the debate itself also serves their goal of distracting the public from the underlying realities of how the rules are generated and changed, their own power over this process, and the extent to which they gain from the results. In other words, not only do these &#x201c;free market&#x201d; advocates want the public to agree with them about the superiority of the market but also about the central importance of this interminable debate.<br><br>They are helped by the fact that the underlying rules are well hidden in an economy where so much of what is owned and traded is becoming intangible and complex. Rules governing intellectual property, for example, are harder to see than the rules of an older economy in which property took the tangible forms of land, factories, and machinery. Likewise, monopolies and market power were clearer in the days of giant railroads and oil trusts than they are now, when a Google, Apple, Facebook, or Comcast can gain dominance over a network, platform, or communications system. At the same time, contracts were simpler to parse when buyers and sellers were on more or less equal footing and could easily know or discover what the other party was promising. That was before the advent of complex mortgages, consumer agreements, franchise systems, and employment contracts, all of whose terms are now largely dictated by one party. Similarly, financial obligations were clearer when banking was simpler and the savings of some were loaned to others who wanted to buy homes or start businesses. In today&#x2019;s world of elaborate financial instruments, by contrast, it is sometimes difficult to tell who owes what to whom, or when, or why.<br><br>Before we can understand the consequences of all of this for modern capitalism, it is first necessary to address basic questions about how government has organized and reorganized the market, what interests have had the most influence on this process, and who has gained and who has lost as a result. To do so, we must examine the market mechanism in some detail.<br><br>2<br><br>The Five Building Blocks of Capitalism<br><br>In order to have a &#x201c;free market,&#x201d; decisions must be made about<br><br>�property: what can be owned<br><br>�monopoly: what degree of market power is permissible<br><br>�contract: what can be bought and sold, and on what terms<br><br>�bankruptcy: what happens when purchasers can&#x2019;t pay up<br><br>�enforcement: how to make sure no one cheats on any of these rules<br><br>You might think such decisions obvious. Ownership, for ex- ample, is simply a matter of what you&#x2019;ve created or bought or invented, what&#x2019;s yours.<br><br>Think again. What about slaves? The human genome? A nuclear bomb? A recipe? Most contemporary societies have decided you can&#x2019;t own these things. You can own land, a car, mobile devices, a home, and all the things that go into a home. But the most important form of property is now intellectual property&#x2014;�new designs, ideas, and inventions. What exactly counts as intellectual property, and how long can you own it?<br><br>Decisions also underlie what degree of market power is permissible&#x2014;�how large and economically potent a company or small group of firms can become, or to what extent dominance over a standard platform or search engine unduly constrains competition.<br><br>Similarly, you may think buying and selling is simply a matter of agreeing on a price&#x2014;�just supply and demand. But most societies have decided against buying and selling sex, babies, and votes. Most don&#x2019;t allow the sale of dangerous drugs, unsafe foods, or deceptive Ponzi schemes. Similarly, most civilized societies do not allow or enforce contracts that are coerced or that are based on fraud. But what exactly does &#x201c;coercion&#x201d; mean? Or even &#x201c;fraud&#x201d;?<br><br>Other decisions govern unpaid debts: Big corporations can use bankruptcy to rid themselves of burdensome pension obligations to their employees, for example, while homeowners cannot use bankruptcy to reduce burdensome mortgages, and former students cannot use it to reduce burdensome student debts.<br><br>And we rely on decisions about how all these rules are enforced&#x2014;�the priorities of police, inspectors, and prosecutors; who can participate in government rule making; who has standing to sue; and the outcomes of judicial proceedings.<br><br>Many of these decisions are far from obvious and some of them change over time, either because social values change (think of slavery), technologies change (patents on novel arrangements of molecules), or the people with power to influence these decisions change (not just public officials, but the people who got them into their positions).<br><br>These decisions don&#x2019;t &#x201c;intrude&#x201d; on the free market. They constitute the free market. Without them there is no market.<br><br>What guides these decisions? What do the people who make the rules seek to achieve? The rules can be designed to maximize efficiency (given the current distribution of income and wealth in society), or growth (depending on who benefits from that growth and what a society is willing to sacrifice to achieve it, such as fouling the environment), or fairness (depending on prevailing norms about what constitutes a fair and decent society); or they can be designed to maximized the profits of large corporations and big banks, and the wealth of those already very wealthy. <br><br>If a democracy is working as it should, elected officials, agency heads, and judges will be making the rules roughly in accordance with the values of most citizens. As philosopher John Rawls has suggested, a fair choice of rule would reflect the views of the typical citizen who did not know how he or she would be affected by its application. Accordingly, the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; would generate outcomes that improved the well-�being of the vast majority.<br><br>But if a democracy is failing (or never functioned to begin with), the rules might instead enhance the wealth of a comparative few at the top while keeping almost everyone else relatively poor and economically insecure. Those with sufficient power and resources would have enough influence over politicians, regulatory heads, and judges to ensure that the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; worked mostly on their behalf.<br><br>This is not corruption as commonly understood. In the United States, those with power and resources rarely directly bribe public officials in order to receive specific and visible favors, such as advantageous government contracts. Instead, they make campaign contributions and occasionally hold out the promise of lucrative jobs at the end of government careers. And the most valuable things they get in exchange are market rules that seem to apply to everyone and appear to be neutral, but that systematically and disproportionately benefit them. To state the matter another way, it is not the unique and perceptible government &#x201c;intrusions&#x201d; into the market that have the greatest effect on who wins and who loses; it is the way government organizes the market.<br><br>Power and influence are hidden inside the processes through which market rules are made, and the resulting economic gains and losses are disguised as the &#x201c;natural&#x201d; outcomes of &#x201c;impersonal market forces.&#x201d; Yet as long as we remain obsessed by the debate over the relative merits of the &#x201c;free market&#x201d; and &#x201c;government,&#x201d; we have little hope of seeing through the camouflage.<br><br>Before examining each of the five building blocks of capitalism separately, it is useful to see how political power shapes all of them and why market freedom cannot be understood apart from how such power is exercised, and by whom.</p><h2>The Jemima Code: Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks</h2><p><p><b>Winner, James Beard Foundation Book Award, 2016<br>Art of Eating Prize, 2015<br>BCALA Outstanding Contribution to Publishing Citation, Black Caucus of the American Library Association, 2016</b></p><p>Women of African descent have contributed to America&#x2019;s food culture for centuries, but their rich and varied involvement is still overshadowed by the demeaning stereotype of an illiterate &#x201c;Aunt Jemima&#x201d; who cooked mostly by natural instinct. To discover the true role of black women in the creation of American, and especially southern, cuisine, Toni Tipton-Martin has spent years amassing one of the world&#x2019;s largest private collections of cookbooks published by African American authors, looking for evidence of their impact on American food, families, and communities and for ways we might use that knowledge to inspire community wellness of every kind.</p><p><i>The Jemima Code</i> presents more than 150 black cookbooks that range from a rare 1827 house servant&#x2019;s manual, the first book published by an African American in the trade, to modern classics by authors such as Edna Lewis and Vertamae Grosvenor. The books are arranged chronologically and illustrated with photos of their covers; many also display selected interior pages, including recipes. Tipton-Martin provides notes on the authors and their contributions and the significance of each book, while her chapter introductions summarize the cultural history reflected in the books that follow. These cookbooks offer firsthand evidence that African Americans cooked creative masterpieces from meager provisions, educated young chefs, operated food businesses, and nourished the African American community through the long struggle for human rights. <i>The Jemima Code</i> transforms America&#x2019;s most maligned kitchen servant into an inspirational and powerful model of culinary wisdom and cultural authority.</p></p><p>Toni Tipton-Martin is a culinary journalist and community activist, a coauthor of A Taste of Heritage: The New African American Cuisine, contributor to Culinaria: The United States, and editor of a new edition of The Blue Grass Cook Book by Minnie C. Fox. Her collection of over 300 African American cookbooks has been exhibited at the James Beard House, and she has twice been invited to the White House to participate in First Lady Michelle Obama&#x2019;s programs to raise a healthier generation of kids. Tipton-Martin is a founding member of the Southern Foodways Alliance and Foodways Texas."The Jemima Code is no ordinary book. It&#x2019;s a heaping helping, a long overdue acknowledgment of African-Americans who have toiled in this field since the country&#x2019;s beginnings. With eloquence and&nbsp;urgency, Tipton-Martin makes the case that without the people of the African diaspora not only would America&#x2019;s food be different, so would its culinary conversation." (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"[The Jemima Code is] that rare coffee table book that serves up important history and compelling imagery in digestible, bite-size chunks that still stick to your ribs." (<i>Michel Martin, NPR's Best Books of 2015</i>)<br><br>"A beautiful and essential corrective to the ongoing erasure of generations of black American culinaria and its indelible influence on American cuisine writ large." (<i>The New Yorker, "The Best Cookbooks of the Century So Far"</i> 2019-07-14)<br><br>"In this beautiful compendium of two hundred years of nearly invisible work by African American cooks, Toni Tipton-Martin changes the American culinary narrative. She reveals the Jemima Code as what it is: a systemic denial of the culinary contribution of the community that largely shaped the American appetite. I feel lucky to have this book on my shelf."

[they] help illustrate the sophistication and expertise that African-American women brought to the kitchens in which they worked. " (<i>Women in the World, New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Tipton-Martin presents a new look at the influence of black chefs and their recipes on American food culture. Her goals are two-fold: to expand the broader community&#x2019;s perception of African-American culinary traditions and to inspire African Americans to embrace their culinary history." (<i>Smithsonian Magazine</i>)<br><br>"Toni Tipton-Martin does a great job of setting the record straight with her book The Jemima Code . . . she classifies, introduces, explains, and puts into context many African-American cookbooks from the last hundred and fifty years or so, often illustrating the text with images and pages from the original works she discusses. She not only offers her own interpretations, but also allows readers to get a sense of the language, the style, as well as the visual and material worlds that the African-American authors of the past inhabited. Above all, Tipton-Martin demonstrates how these men and women were not victims, but expressed their own personality and agency in their work, striving to be accomplished cooks or ma�tre d's."

I tend several flower beds, write a column every week, answer an awful lot of mail, do the housework and cooking-and never do any of these things after 11 o'clock in the morning!" </p><p>Her first book about her no-work gardening system, <i>How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back,</i> was the kind of book people can't bear to return. She reports, "A dentist in Pennsylvania and a doctor in Oregon have both written me that they keep a copy of my garden book in their waiting rooms. Or try to; the dentist has had twenty-three copies stolen, the doctor, sixteen." </p><p><i>Gardening Without Work</i> is her second gardening book and is even more entertaining and instructional than the first, so hide it from your friends! </p><p>How does it work? "And now let's get down to business. The labor-saving part of my system is that I never plow, spade, sow a cover crop, harrow, hoe, cultivate, weed, water or irrigate, or spray. I use just one fertilizer (cottonseed or soybean meal), and I don't go through the tortuous business of building a compost pile. Just yesterday, under the "Questions and Answers" in a big reputable farm paper, someone asked how to make a compost pile and the editor explained the arduous performance. After I read this I lay there on the couch and suffered because the victim's address wasn't given; there was no way I could reach him. </p><p>"My way is simply to keep a thick mulch of any vegetable matter that rots on both my vegetable and flower garden all year round. As it decays and enriches the soil, I add more." </p><p>Regardless of topic, Ruth Stout's writing is always about living a joyous and independent life, and <i>Gardening Without Work</i> is no exception!

First published in 1961, this Norton Creek Press version is an exact reproduction of the original edition. </p><p>Ruth Stout, who, in her teens helped temperance activist Carrie Nation smash saloon windows, could turn any aspect of life into an adventure.

Every Christian generation turns to it for insight and guidance.<br><br>In this volume, a recognized expert on the Gospels shows that the Sermon on the Mount offers a clear window into understanding God's work in Christ. Jonathan Pennington provides a historical, theological, and literary commentary on the Sermon and explains how this text offers insight into God's plan for human flourishing. As Pennington explores the literary dimensions and theological themes of this famous passage, he situates the Sermon in dialogue with the Jewish and Greek virtue traditions and the philosophical-theological question of human flourishing. He also relates the Sermon's theological themes to contemporary issues such as ethics, philosophy, and economics.</p><p>"Pennington's reading of the Sermon on the Mount is a remarkable piece of work: erudite, careful, balanced, and fresh. Grounded in meticulous historical exegesis but shaped by a distinctive sensitivity to theological hermeneutics, the book succeeds in proclaiming what is often undersold in our evangelicalism--the goodness of the good news by which we come to flourish."<br>--<b>Grant Macaskill</b>, University of Aberdeen<br><br>"When it comes to the Sermon on the Mount, many scholars find it difficult to comprehend the Sermon, let alone to make a contribution to the history of Christian thinking about it. Pennington has accomplished both, baptizing this great collection of Jesus's teachings into the wisdom tradition of human flourishing and virtue ethics. Even where I disagree with Pennington, I have learned from his logical and clear case for the Sermon as a summons to human flourishing. This book will prove to be an exceptional classroom tool as well as a preacher's steady resource."<br>--<b>Scot McKnight</b>, Northern Seminary<br><br>"Is there need for <i>another</i> book on the Sermon on the Mount? Yes, because few others combine the strengths, clarity, pathos, and insight of this one. It is rooted in wide reading across many centuries and traditions. It takes full measure of the range of methods available to shed light on the passage. It is alert to personal transformation as a justified aim in reading. It is balanced, hermeneutically informed, and academically grounded without failing to be pastorally useful as well as theologically responsible. Readers of all stripes will benefit from interaction with Pennington's expositions and sometimes painfully honest wrestlings."<br>--<b>Robert&nbsp;W. Yarbrough</b>, Covenant Theological Seminary<br><br>"In this insightful volume, Pennington brings his expertise in the Gospels (and Matthew in particular) to bear on the theological masterpiece that is the Sermon on the Mount. Pennington finds in the Sermon an 'eschatological, Christ-centered, kingdom-oriented piece of wisdom literature,' whose unified theme is the goal of human flourishing. I found Pennington's careful exegesis and balanced conclusions thoroughly convincing."<br>--<b>Mark&nbsp;L. Strauss</b>, Bethel Seminary San Diego<br><br>"Pennington invites readers to consider anew the First Gospel's Sermon on the Mount. Situating the Sermon's message in the nexus of Second Temple Jewish wisdom and the Greco-Roman virtue traditions, Pennington unlocks the potential of the Sermon for the church in the twenty-first century. In his reading, the Sermon bids humans into a way-of-being-in-the-world that produces a foretaste in the present of the whole-person, full-human flourishing promised in the eschaton through the practice of Jesus's words."<br>--<b>Joel Willitts</b>, North Park University"You have heard it said that the Sermon on the Mount is an impossible ideal, but Jonathan Pennington says to you that it brings blessing and virtue, wholeness and excellence through the wise words of King Jesus. The Sermon on the Mount has informed theological ethics and Christian discipleship for centuries, but often readers have not known quite what to do with these instructions. Pennington here offers a comparative and literary analysis that brilliantly plots the text's portrayal of the good life of the gospel against other portraits of the virtuous life in Jewish and Greco-Roman literature of the day."<br>--<b>Michael Allen</b>, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando<br><br>"Pennington has written an exegetically sane and readable commentary on the Sermon on the Mount that also provides a macroscopic reading strategy focusing on how the Sermon envisions the realization of true human flourishing. Pennington argues what may be surprising to many today: human flourishing does not come by ignoring the law of God but by doing the will of God as whole persons. Pennington recognizes the need for balance between the unique work of Jesus in Matthew--who saves his people from their sins--and the necessity for his disciples to live in accord with the ethics of the kingdom. Pennington's exposition of Jesus's teaching has numerous implications for how we approach life today and deserves careful consideration. For anyone who has ever asked, what is the good life?, here is an answer that interacts robustly with the biblical text in its ancient context. This is a creative, substantive, and worthwhile contribution to the study of the Sermon on the Mount."<br>--<b>Brandon&nbsp;D. Crowe</b>, Westminster Theological Seminary<br><br>"Pennington offers a helpful prolegomenon to the study of the Sermon on the Mount. His fresh proposal of a new paradigm for interpreting the Sermon exhibits an awareness of the major trajectories in the history of interpretation and judiciously engages the most recent scholarly discussions. Not content with mere theory, Pennington applies his paradigm in a brief commentary on the Sermon. Along the way he offers many insights that will enrich one's study of Jesus's ethical teaching. This is essential reading for scholars interested in synoptic studies."<br>--<b>Charles Quarles</b>, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><h2>Cancer Ward: A Novel (FSG Classics)</h2><p><p><b>The Russian Nobelist's semiautobiographical novel set in a Soviet cancer ward shortly after Stalin's death</b></p><p>One of the great allegorical masterpieces of world literature, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's <i>Cancer Ward</i> is both a deeply compassionate study of people facing terminal illness and a brilliant dissection of the cancerous Soviet police state.<br><i></i><br><i>Cancer Ward</i>, which has been compared to the masterpiece of another Nobel Prize winner, <i>The Magic Mountain </i>by Thomas Mann, examines the relationship of a group of people in the cancer ward of a provincial Soviet hospital in 1955, two years after Stalin's death.

Although permitted to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> in 1962--which remained his only full-length work to have appeared in his homeland until 1990--Solzhenitsyn was by 1969 expelled from the Writers' Union. The publication in the West of his other novels and, in particular, of <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i>, brought retaliation from the authorities. In 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and forcibly flown to Frankfurt. Solzhenitsyn and his wife and children moved to the United States in 1976.

The writing is engaging and clear, and the author takes great care to support his arguments. Further, Wallin clearly shows the capacity to think in an integrative and holistic manner.

Wallin's ambitious and deeply satisfying book is remarkable for a number of reasons....Wallin is a seasoned, experienced clinician, with a deep appreciation of the complexities of both clinical work and human development. Thus, his clinical voice, and his insights into the clinical experience (both the patient's as well as the therapist's) unify each of his forays into research, theory, and science. Indeed, it is his ability to engage all of these elements at once that makes this such a gem of a book....This book should be essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary psychoanalysis. Few writers have the ability to write so directly and clearly about complex science and theory; his scholarship and reach are extraordinary. This book is also a book for therapists at all levels of experience....He creates a truly contemporary vision of human development, affect regulation, and relational processes, grounded in the body and in the brain, and in the fundamental relationships that make us who we are, as therapists, as patients, and as human beings.&#x201d;, <i>Psychotherapy</i> Published On: 2009-01-01</p><h2>A Treasury of Mother Goose</h2><p>A new collection of old and familiar nursery rhymes -- rhymes that stay alive from generation to generation because they move in lively rhythms.

At the same time, trained observers record and code their behavior or body language, facial expressions, voice inflection&#x2014;all of which is later connected to their dialogue and physical reactions. &#x201c;Do the partners look at each other when speaking to each other, smile, or frown? . . . Do they lean into each other or lean away? Are they open and expansive or closed and contracted? How long does it take for their voices to sound angry?&#x201d; It is a lot of data and it is analyzed meticulously.<br><br>Dr. Gottman&#x2019;s data-heavy approach has been incorporated into the work of thousands of therapists, and has changed the course of countless relationships. He has challenged traditional marriage counseling techniques. He has suggested that some of the techniques that therapists routinely use simply do not make much of a difference in a marriage, and may even be counterproductive. For instance, the idea of &#x201c;active listening,&#x201d; where partners are encouraged to use &#x201c;I statements&#x201d; and play back what their partner is feeling in a conversation. For many years this has been the bedrock of marriage counseling. Yet according to Gottman&#x2019;s data, it makes virtually no difference in the success of a relationship or in therapy.<br><br>According to Gottman, &#x201c;If your partner is saying, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re terrible,&#x2019; according to active listening, you are supposed to be able to empathize and be understanding. We found in our research that hardly anybody does that, even in great marriages. When somebody attacks them, they attack right back.&#x201d;<br><br>Gottman says, &#x201c;Well, it kind of makes sense. Let&#x2019;s say my wife is really angry with me because I repeatedly haven&#x2019;t balanced the checkbook and the checks bounce. I keep saying: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, and I&#x2019;ll try not to do it again.&#x2019; So finally she gets angry and confronts me in a therapy session. What would it accomplish if I say: &#x2018;I hear what you&#x2019;re saying, you&#x2019;re really angry with me, and I can understand why you&#x2019;re angry with me because I&#x2019;m not balancing the checkbook.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s not going to make her feel any better; I still haven&#x2019;t balanced the damned checkbook!&#x201d;<br><br>His lab identified negative behavior patterns that can take couples down the path to divorce. One is negative criticism, stating your complaints as a defect in your partner&#x2019;s personality: &#x201c;You always talk about yourself. You are so selfish.&#x201d; Another negative behavior is contempt: statements that come from a relative position of superiority. Contempt is the greatest single predictor of divorce. For example, telling your partner, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an idiot.&#x201d; A third is defensiveness: making excuses for one&#x2019;s behavior or accusing your partner&#x2014;&#x201c;You always blame me, I am always the bad guy.&#x201d; Defensiveness is used to ward off a perceived attack. The last is stonewalling and emotional withdrawal, such as when the listener intentionally ignores the speaker, fails to provide the usual nonverbal signals that the listener is &#x201c;tracking&#x201d; the speaker, or simply doesn&#x2019;t respond to what the speaker is communicating.<br><br>What Dr. Gottman was able to determine is that success is less about the &#x201c;chemistry&#x201d; that exists between a couple and has more to do with how they manage their own internal chemistry as they interact under the pressure of threatening conversations.<br><br>The more a couple/individual cannot handle pressure, the more &#x201c;physiologically aroused, mentally rigid, and impulsive they become during a conflict. This state of affairs increases the likelihood they will engage in destructive communication patterns that inevitably decrease marital satisfaction and increase marital dissatisfaction.&#x201d; Dr. Gottman found that happily married couples handle the pressure of conflict more effectively and are able to make conversational repair attempts even in the middle of an argument.<br><br>At heart, what the Love Lab has found is that if you want your marriage to be long and enjoyable, you need to learn to handle pressure&#x2014;and hope your partner can handle it too.<br><br>Truths About Pressure<br><br>There are three basic and powerful truths about pressure. They are powerful because they influence our life every day, often in ways that we are not aware of, and almost always to our detriment.<br><br>The first is that pressure disrupts what we value most: our relationships, our careers, our parenting effectiveness, and our core ethical and moral decision-making. The consequences of pressure can break a marriage, derail a career, and cause children to pull away from their parents or feel the need to cheat to meet their parents&#x2019; expectations. And it can compromise our very integrity.<br><br>The second truth is that people who handle pressure better than others do not &#x201c;rise to the occasion&#x201d; or perform statistically better than they do in non-pressure situations. If you are a sports fan, you&#x2019;ve been fed a myth by the media that some athletes are &#x201c;clutch&#x201d; performers who do better under pressure. Or maybe you&#x2019;ve heard that some people at work do more creative work, are more productive, work better as a team, or add more value to a client under pressure. But it&#x2019;s not true. Moreover, perpetuating this fiction only exacerbates poor performance under pressure.<br><br>The third truth, confirmed by our study of more than twelve thousand people and conducted over a ten-year period, is that you simply need to leverage the natural pressure management tools each of us already possesses to counteract pressure&#x2019;s injurious effects. When it comes to handling pressure, most individuals fail to leverage these tools, and thus handicap themselves.<br><br>These insights regarding pressure have specific applications in organizations of all kinds because individuals and teams react to pressure in predictable ways. Being aware of these truths in your daily activities will help you achieve your best possible performance when you need it the most. More important, it will allow you to remove the damaging effects that pressure creates for you. Let&#x2019;s look at a few examples of people under pressure both within organizations and outside of organizations to see why they react as they do, and to better understand the circumstances that amplify the negative effects of pressure.<br><br>The Sabotaging Force of Pressure<br><br>Heidi K. Gardner is an assistant professor of Business Administration in the Organizational Behavior Unit at Harvard, where she studies how pressure impacts team dynamics. Professor Gardner&#x2019;s research suggests that teams like to think they do their best work when the stakes are highest&#x2014;when the company&#x2019;s future or their own future rests on the outcome. But that is not what happens. In extensive studies of teams at professional service firms, Professor Gardner saw the same pattern repeat itself: Teams become increasingly caught up with the risks of failure, rather than with the requirements of excellence. As a result, they revert to safe, standard approaches, instead of offering original solutions tailored to clients&#x2019; needs.<br><br>She found that when teams face significant performance pressure, they tend to defer to high-status members, at the expense of using expert team members. This would be analogous to a team of physicians ignoring the expertise of the best surgeon in the group and deferring to another doctor who is not a specialist in the field but he or she is senior on the staff.<br><br>Gardner labels this phenomenon the performance pressure paradox. Here&#x2019;s how it develops: As pressure mounts, team members drive toward consensus in ways that shut out vital information. Without realizing it, they give more weight to shared knowledge and dismiss specialized expertise, such as insights into the client&#x2019;s technologies, culture, and aspirations. The more generically inclined the team becomes, the more mediocre the solutions they offer.<br><br>The effects of pressure show up not just in our marriages and work; they also influence the choices we make, at all ages.<br><br>Vinay Mayar was the 2010 valedictorian of Stuyvesant High School, widely regarded as the best of the nine elite New York City public high schools that select students based on a highly competitive Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT). The school is a regular feeder to the most prestigious colleges and universities in America.<br><br>In his valedictorian commencement speech, Mayar, who now attends MIT, talked about the pressure at school. He referred to his classmates as &#x201c;a volatile mix of strong-minded people armed in opposition against one other.&#x201d; He listed what his friends said epitomized the Stuyvesant experience: &#x201c;copying homework in the hallway while walking to class&#x201d;; &#x201c;sneaking in and out of school during free periods&#x201d;; and &#x201c;widespread Facebook cheating.&#x201d; Only a few months earlier, Stuyvesant had been the scene of one of the most notorious acts of cheating to take place at a high school; it involved more than one hundred &#x201c;excellent&#x201d; students in a ring of deception. But Stuyvesant is not alone. Cheating scandals are hardly rare at elite, pressure-cooker high schools and colleges.<br><br>Just months from graduation from Leland High School, an acclaimed public school in San Jose, California, nine seniors were accused of taking part in a cheating ring. One student was said to have broken into at least two classrooms to steal test information before winter exams. A top-notch junior from Panther Creek High School in Cary, North Carolina, was busted for distributing a test to four classmates. Some twenty students from Great Neck, Roslyn, and other Long Island Gold Coast towns were arrested in an SAT cheating ring. In 2012, more than a hundred students were caught cheating in the same Harvard class in US Government.<br><br>Why do smart kids cheat? On the surface, it doesn&#x2019;t make sense. They are bright enough to get ahead honestly. We now understand enough about brain science to lay some of the blame on biology. Current research shows that the parts of the brain responsible for impulse control (measured in the lateral prefrontal cortex) may not completely develop until early adulthood, while the parts that boost sensation-seeking (the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex) start growing just after puberty begins. Teenagers may cheat (or do drugs or drive too fast) partly because their sense of the thrill outweighs their sense of the risk.<br><br>The phenomenon is magnified when peers&#x2014;friends&#x2014;are present, which may help explain why teens often cheat in groups. A 2010 Temple University study found that when playing a driving video game, teenagers were more likely to take big risks and even crash when their friends were watching than they were when playing the game alone.<br><br>But a more plausible explanation put forth by educators and psychologists (and Vinay Mayar, the Stuyvesant valedictorian) is that cheating is caused by pressure. Sally Rubenstone, a Massachusetts-based senior advisor with College Confidential, puts it this way: &#x201c;The pressure these kids feel to do well on the tests makes kids feel cheating is necessary.&#x201d; Gabe Kaplan, principal of Great Neck North High School, concurs: &#x201c;With intensity to do well on tests comes pressure to cheat.&#x201d;<br><br>Every day, kids are susceptible to peer pressure, which often makes our children engage in activities that later come back to haunt them. Drug use is one, bullying another. One can also add irresponsible adolescent sexual activity, and the most tragic consequence of teen pressure: suicide. The message is clear: Our kids might be smart, but pressure can cause them to use bad judgment and do foolish things.<br><br>Most of us think of pressure as situation-specific: the bottom of the ninth, taking the SATs, or giving a presentation in front of management. Yet the reality is that pressure is a daily force that infiltrates our everyday activities and builds up to the moment when everything is on the line.<br><br>Nancy Medoff, a senior director of Global Sales for Marriott International, describes what we mean. She calls it The Challenge:<br><br>&#x201c;Technology increases the expectation that we need to be on 24/7, everyone expects a response NOW, and we are all moving at the speed of light. This creates a constant feeling that I am falling behind. Then there are &#x2018;pressure spikes&#x2019; where something new gets added to your plate. For example, this year Marriott added a well-known Caribbean resort to its Autograph collection. It&#x2019;s an amazing property, so almost overnight, customers were calling wanting to know more about it, availability for groups&#x2014;and we need to be the experts and handle the new workload on top of what we are already doing.<br><br>&#x201c;When the pressure spikes like this, I start feeling like I&#x2019;m not getting enough done and I feel overwhelmed. If I am not managing the pressure, then I start responding to e-mails right away, being more reactive, and I can have an impact on people I don&#x2019;t want to have. It affects my leadership and the performance of my team.</p><h2>20 Master Plots: And How to Build Them</h2><p><p><b>Give your story a solid foundation&#x2014;a plot that engages readers from start to finish!</b></p><p>The best stories linger in the hearts and minds of readers for decades.

Ready to challenge conventional thinking or introduce a new idea, but worried about being viewed as a troublemaker or getting in way over your head? <br><br><i><b>Rebels At Work</b></i> provides concrete ideas, techniques and advice on how to refine your thinking, improve your approach to work, and manage yourself so you can achieve more and stay sane and optimistic in the process. <br><br>Authors Lois Kelly and Carmen Medina -- successful and occasionally wildly unsuccessful rebels themselves, Lois at marketing agencies, Carmen at the CIA -- reveal ways to navigate corporate politics, frame and communicate ideas, deal with controversy, avoid common mistakes, and manage yourself so you know when and how to keep pushing and when to quit.</p><p><b>What value do most rebels bring to the table?</b><br><b></b>Rebels have the courage to name the elephants in the room, see new ways to solve problems, bring outside ideas into the organization, and be the first to try new approaches.&nbsp; Our research&nbsp; found that rebels call out problems others are afraid to (92%) and challenge assumptions and sacred cow practices (92%), both of which are essential to real innovation, but often shunned in organizations.<br><br>The other overlooked value rebels bring is devotion to duty. Rebels care more about their organizations than most people. That's why we ask the difficult questions that most people feel more comfortable avoiding, and risk being snubbed for suggesting unpopular ideas.&nbsp; We want our organizations to be the very best and we believe that our colleagues and we have what it takes to achieve more than our competitors.<br><br><b>Why are many managers afraid/intimidated by rebels at work?</b><br>Our ideas often threaten managers' craving for status and certainty.<br>An overwhelming number of managers believe that they are supposed to create the strategy and have the answers -- and employees are meant to execute on those ideas. Not question them. I'm the boss.&nbsp; Hence, I know more and you should respect me for it.&nbsp; It sounds silly in this day and age of empowerment and collaboration, but protecting status can lead all of us to act in illogical ways. The worse case is that people at work become complacent and disillusioned, not good for people or businesses that employe them.<br><br> We humans are also wired to crave certainty. So when we rebels present innovative ideas that have no best practice precedents we trigger fears about certainty. Managers worry, "How will we know this will work? What if we make a mistake?" You get the picture. The last threat is autonomy. Our managers like doing things their way. To suggest something different is to violate their sense of control and autonomy over what they know and like.<br><br><b>What is most surprising about rebels at work?</b><br>How many closeted, positive rebels there are, and how much untapped talent is available to organizations.&nbsp; People are yearning to do more at work, but they're afraid of the backlash from speaking up. Few have had any training or mentoring on&nbsp; how to bring new ideas to the table and work the politics and controversy that inevitably come with any change.&nbsp; That's why we wrote this book.&nbsp; We wish someone had given us this advice when we were younger.

Dana was last seen romping around with her family in Massachusetts.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014; With four brothers, a dog, a cat, school projects, soccer matches, and a grumpy neighbor, the Fletchers are your typical American family...with two dads, and siblings who are adopted kids from various ethnic backgrounds. While 12-year-old Sam ponders whether trying out for the school play will interfere with his identity as a soccer player, 10-year-old Jax negotiates changing friendships and a veteran project that involves talking to the unfriendly Vietnam vet next door. Meanwhile, Eli, also age 10, finds that his new, academically oriented school isn't everything he expected it would be, and six-year-old Frog attempts to convince his family that his kindergarten best friend is not imaginary. Turtles and kittens are requested, camping trips are taken, and holiday celebrations (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Chanukah, and Christmas) involve minor kitchen fires, missing turkeys, and other mishaps. Through it all, Dad and Papa complain about the mischief as often as they join in themselves. Although the tone is never preachy, the brothers nevertheless learn over the course of the year that identities can expand, friendships can evolve, and making mistakes is okay. With its semi-episodic structure, laugh-out-loud humor, and mix of zaniness and love, Levy's debut offers something truly significant: a middle-grade family story featuring gay parents and interracial families that is never about either issue. Fans of Beverly Cleary's Quimbys, Judy Blume's Hatchers, and, more recently, Jeanne Birdsall's Penderwicks will fervently hope that more Fletcher misadventures are yet to come.&#x2014;Jill Ratzan, I.

Raised in a military family, he attended ten schools in five states, as well as three schools in France. Even as an adult he kept moving, and in fact he became a writer in part because it was one of the few jobs that wouldn&#x2019;t tie him down.

And remember Drake the Whip Hand? Yeah, he might be back, too. Grant continues to hurtle through an endlessly fascinating (and increasingly grim) story line; his chief achievement, though, is how the X-Men&#x2013;style powers of his cast never overwhelm the mournful realization that their world is slowly degenerating into brutality.

She'd been at his side, his rough, callused hand between her own, when it happened. For hours she'd sat with him, watching the intermittent rise and fall of his chest, waiting, wondering if this breath would be his last, praying it wasn't. Clinging to what little life was left in him. <br><br>Bernard Clemens had refused to die in a hospital and at his request, she'd brought him home. The hospice people had been wonderful, assisting Bernard in maintaining his dignity to the very end. Margaret had stayed with her father almost constantly the final week of his life. <br><br>She watched him draw his last shallow breath, watched him pass peacefully, silently, from one life to the next. Margaret wasn't sure what she'd expected to feel, but certainly not this torrent of agony and grief. She'd known he was dying, known it for months, and she'd thought that knowledge would blunt the sharp rawness of her pain. It hadn't. <i>Her father was gone. </i>She'd spent every day of her life with him, here on the Triple C, and now she was alone. In time, she realized, she'd be able to look back and see the blessing her father had been, but not yet. Not when her loss hurt as much as it did now. <br><br>She'd waited until she'd composed herself and then, dry-eyed, walked out of the large bedroom and awakened the sleeping family members, who'd gathered at the ranch. She'd announced that Bernard had died and his death had been peaceful. No tears were shed. That wasn't how grief was expressed in the Clemens family. <br><br>Almost immediately, everyone had found a purpose and the house was filled with activity. More and more people arrived, and then, two days later, it was time for the funeral. Bernard Clemens's three surviving brothers stood at the grave site with Margaret; they stayed long enough to greet folks and thank them for coming. Then they left, to return to their own families, their own lives. <br><br>The reception following the funeral was well attended. Nearly everyone in Buffalo Valley came to pay their respects. Hassie Knight, who owned Knight's Pharmacy, took charge of organizing the event. She'd been a family friend for many years. At least a hundred people had gathered at the large ranch house, and there was more food than Margaret could eat in six weeks. She never had understood why people brought casseroles and desserts for a wake; the last thing she wanted to think about was eating. <br><br>"Margaret, I'm so sorry," Sarah Urlacher told her, gently taking her hand and holding it. She was sincere, and her kindness touched Margaret's heart. Sarah's husband, Dennis, stood with her. His eyes revealed genuine compassion. <br><br>Margaret nodded, wishing she knew the couple better. It was her father who was well acquainted with the folks in Buffalo Valley. He'd been doing business there for years. Dennis delivered fuel to the ranch, so Margaret at least knew him, even if their relationship was just a casual one. Sarah owned and operated Buffalo Valley Quilts, a growing enterprise that seemed to be attracting interest all around the country. Margaret knew Sarah only by sight; they hadn't shared more than a few perfunctory greetings. <br><br>She wanted to thank everyone for coming&#x2014;she really did appreciate their expressions of sympathy and respect&#x2014;and at the same time f ind a way to steer them out the door. Making conversation with people she hardly knew was beyond her. She was polite, cordial, but a tightness had gripped her chest, and it demanded every ounce of restraint she could muster not to rush to the barn, saddle Midnight and ride until she was too exhausted to go farther. <br><br>Bob and Merrily Carr came next, with their little boy, Axel. They owned and operated 3 OF A KIND, Buffalo Valley's bar and grill. After that, the banker, Heath Quantrill, offered his condolences. Rachel Fischer was with him, and if Margaret remembered correctly, they were a couple now. <br><br>Ranchers and farmers crowded the house. So many people. There barely seemed room to breathe. <br><br>"Do you need anything?" Maddy McKenna asked with a gentleness that nearly broke Margaret's facade. Maddy was the best friend she'd ever had. If anyone understood, it would be Maddy. <br><br>"I want everyone to leave," Margaret whispered, f ighting back emotion. The lump in her throat refused to go away and she had trouble talking around it. <br><br>Maddy took Margaret by the arm and led her down the long hallway to her bedroom. The two of them had spent many an afternoon in this very room; at Margaret's entreaty, Maddy had tried to instruct her in the arts of looking and acting feminine&#x2014;feminine enough to attract Matt Eilers. Not that her efforts had been noticed. Not by him, anyway. <br><br>"Sit," Maddy ordered, pointing to Margaret's bed. <br><br>Without argument, Margaret complied. <br><br>"When was the last time you had any sleep?" <br><br>Margaret blinked, unable to recall. "A while ago." The night before the funeral she'd sat up and gone through her father's papers. He had everything in order, as she'd suspected he would. He'd realized months ago that he was dying. <br><br>"Lie down," Maddy said. <br><br>"I have a house full of company," Margaret objected weakly. It went against the grain to let someone dictate what she should or shouldn't do. With anyone else, she'd have made a fuss, insisted it was her place to be with her father's friends. <br><br>"You're dead on your feet," Maddy told her. <br><br>Margaret nestled her head in her pillow, surprised by how good it felt against her face. How cool and comforting. "I...I thought I was prepared," she said, her eyes closed. "I thought I could handle this." <br><br>"No one's ever ready to lose a father," Maddy said as she covered Margaret with the afghan from the foot of the bed. The weight of it settled warmly over her shoulders. <br><br>"Sleep now. By the time you wake, everyone will be gone." <br><br>"Nothing's ever going to be the same again," Margaret whispered. <br><br>"You're right, it won't." <br><br>Maddy's voice sounded soothing, even if her words didn't. But then, Margaret could count on her friend to tell the truth. Already she could feel sleep approach, could feel the tension leave her body. "Matt didn't attend the funeral, did he?" <br><br>"No," Maddy said. <br><br>"I thought he would." She was keenly disappointed that he hadn't bothered to show up. <br><br>"I know." <br><br>Maddy was disappointed in him, too. Margaret could tell from the inf lection in her voice. Few people understood why she loved Matt. If pressured to explain, Margaret wasn't sure she could justify her feelings. Matt Eilers was as handsome as sin, shallow and conceited. But she loved him and had from the moment she'd met him. <br><br>With Maddy's tutoring, Margaret had done everything possible to get Matt to recognize that she was a woman with a woman's heart. A few months back, she'd had her hair done and put on panty hose for the f irst time in her life. The panty hose had nearly wrestled her to the ground and the new hairdo had made her look like one of the Marx Brothers&#x2014;in her opinion, anyway. The whole beautifying operation had been a unique form of torture, but she'd willingly do it all again for Matt. <br><br>"I'm sure he'll stop by later and pay his respects," Margaret whispered, conf ident that he would. <br><br>"He should have been here today." Maddy wasn't nearly as forgiving. "Don't worry about Matt." <br><br>"I'm not." <br><br>"Call me in the morning," Maddy said. <br><br>"I will," she promised, exhausted and grateful for Maddy's friendship. Her last thought before she drifted off to sleep was of the father she loved and how bleak her life would feel without him. <br><br>Jeb McKenna knew his wife well, and her silence worried him as he drove the short distance between the Clemens house and his ranch. Unlike the Clemenses and most other ranchers in the area, Jeb raised bison; Maddy owned the grocery store in town. Right now, though, she was staying home with their infant daughter. <br><br>"You're worried about Margaret, aren't you?" he asked as he turned down the mile-long dirt driveway leading to their home. Maddy had barely said a word after seeing Margaret to her room. <br><br>"She was ready to collapse," Maddy told him. "God only knows the last time she slept. Sadie said she'd been up for two nights straight." <br><br>"Poor thing." One didn't generally think of Margaret in those terms. She came across as tough, strong, capable. They'd been neighbors for about five years&#x2014;ever since Jeb had bought the property&#x2014;and he'd seen Margaret on a number of different occasions. It was some time before he'd realized Margaret was a <i>she </i>instead of a <i>he. </i><br><br>It'd startled him, but he wasn't the only person she'd inadvertently fooled. Maddy confessed that when they'd f irst met, she'd taken Margaret for a ranch hand. <br><br>"Bernard's death has shaken her." <br><br>Jeb understood. Joshua McKenna was in his late sixties now, and Jeb knew that sooner or later he, too, would lose his father. The inevitability of it made him feel a wave of sadness...and regret. He parked the car and turned off the engine. <br><br>"I'll talk to Margaret in the morning," Maddy said absently. <br><br>The October wind beat against him as Jeb climbed out of the vehicle and reached in the back to unfasten Julianne's car seat. At three months she was showing more personality than he would've thought possible. She gurgled and smiled, waving her arms as though orchestrating life from her infant seat. She'd proved to be a good-natured baby, happy and even-tempered. <br><br>Carrying the baby seat, he covered Julianne's face with the blanket and hurried toward the house, doing his best to protect his wife and daughter from the brunt of the wind. <br><br>Maddy switched on the kitchen lights and Jeb set the baby carrier on the recliner, unfastening Julianne and cradling her in his arms. <br><br>"I liked Pastor Dawson," Maddy said casually. <br><br>The Methodist minister had recently taken up residence in town. Although Larry Dawson had grown up in Buffalo Valley, Jeb didn't remember him. That wasn't surprising, seeing that the pastor was near retirement age. Dawson was slight in stature, his hair&#x2014;what was left of it&#x2014;completely white. He hadn't been in contact with Bernard Clemens for many years, but he'd given a respectable eulogy. <br><br>"The pastor invited us to church services on Sunday," she murmured. <br><br>Although it was an offhand remark, Jeb knew Maddy was interested in becoming involved with a church community. He hesitated; the drive into Buffalo Valley took at least fifty minutes, and that was on a good day. Going to church would consume nearly all of Sunday morning. He opened his mouth, about to offer his wife a list of excuses as to why it would be inconvenient to attend. Before he could utter a word, he changed his mind. The fact that she'd mentioned the invitation at all meant this was important to her and shouldn't be taken lightly. <br><br>When he married Maddy, Jeb knew there'd be a number of concessions on his part, but he loved her enough to make them. She'd certainly made concessions of her own&#x2014;one of which was living so far out of town, away from her friends and the grocery she'd purchased a little more than a year ago. Church for Maddy would be a social outlet, and it would uplift her emotionally and spiritually. Women needed that. <br><br>Jeb and Maddy had met soon after she'd bought the one and only grocery store in Buffalo Valley. Her lifelong friend, Lindsay Snyder, had begun teaching at the high school and married Gage Sinclair the following summer. Maddy had been Lindsay's maid of honor; the very day of the wedding she'd decided to settle in Buffalo Valley herself. <br><br>Jeb would be forever grateful that she had. His life changed the day he rescued Maddy during a blizzard. She'd been trapped in her car while delivering groceries and would have frozen to death if he hadn't found her when he did. He'd brought her home with him, never suspecting that their time together would have consequences affecting both their lives. Consequences that included an unexpected pregnancy... He'd fallen in love with her in those three snowbound days. After losing his leg in a farming accident several years earlier, Jeb had thought it would never be possible for him to live a normal life again&#x2014;or to feel normal emotions, normal desires. Maddy had shown him otherwise. They'd been married four months now and he was so much in love with her he had to pinch himself every once in a while to convince himself this was real. <br><br>"What do you think about us attending church services?" she pressed, studying him closely. <br><br>"I think that's a fine idea," he said. It wouldn't hurt and might even do him some good. <br><br>Her smile told him how much she appreciated his response. <br><br>A few minutes later, Maddy eff iciently changed Julianne's diaper, then settled into the rocking chair. She unbuttoned her blouse and bared her breast for their baby. Fascinated, Jeb watched as his infant daughter instinctively turned toward her mother and greedily latched on. <br><br>Maddy rocked gently and hummed a lullaby. It wasn't long before his daughter had taken her fill and Maddy carried her into the nursery to prepare her for the night. <br><br>Jeb had the television on, watching a news broadcast, when Maddy joined him. They'd decided to skip dinner, since they'd eaten the equivalent of a meal at Bernard's wake that afternoon. Now, sitting at her husband's side, Maddy picked up her knitting, a recently learned skill. Leta Betts, a devout knitter and Lindsay's mother-in-law, had taught both Maddy and Lindsay how to knit while they were pregnant. "I wonder what Margaret's going to do now." <br><br>Jeb glanced away from the television long enough to recognize that Maddy needed to talk about this. He reached for the remote control and muted the sound. "It wasn't as though Bernard's death came as a shock." <br><br>"I know. It's just that..." <br><br>"What?" he urged. <br><br>"I'm worried about what'll happen to Margaret without her father there to protect her." <br><br>"How do you mean?" <br><br>"She's alone for the f irst time in her life&#x2014;and vulnerable." <br><br>Jeb frowned. He hadn't given the matter much thought, but Maddy was right. Margaret had lived a sheltered life, protected by her father and his name. <br><br>"She's easy prey for some man. Anyone with a good line can just step in and take advantage of her. Look at all the attention she got at Bob and Merrily's wedding." <br><br>Jeb had no recollection of anything about that night except Maddy. She'd been seven months pregnant with his child. It was the night he'd asked her to marry him and she'd agreed. <br><br></p><h2>The Migraine Relief Plan: An 8-Week Transition to Better Eating, Fewer Headaches, and Optimal Health</h2><p><b>An essential lifestyle guide to reducing headaches and other symptoms related to migraine, vertigo, and Meniere&#x2019;s disease.

Are you ready to &#x2013;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>KNOW YOURSELF in a new way, without judging yourself?</li> <li>ACCEPT ALL YOUR FEELINGS without rejecting them or projecting them onto others, thus remaining in harmony with who you are?</li> <li>LET GO of the perceptions and judgments of the mind, turning instead to the wisdom of your heart?</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This Second Edition contains the supplement, &#x201c;Dialogue Unveiled.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ACOL is more than a book. It offers a new way of living and being. ACOL posits that all changes we would like to see happening in our lives, even in the world, stem from a single change: moving from seeing ourselves as separate individuals, to seeing the truth thatwe are an integral part of life, and of an eternal Consciousness that exists in Unity. ACOL is a call to move into love's embrace.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As we remember our true identity, we let go of previous limiting beliefs that brought about experiences of struggle, loneliness, and pain. Our authentic Self leads us to live in certainty and with a clear sense of meaning and purpose.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ACOL is often experienced as more of a transmission than a text. It keeps on revealing more, even to those who have read it numerous times before. Many readers find it to be truly alive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Though it stands by itself, ACOL is complementary to&nbsp;<em>A Course in Miracles.</em>Like ACIM, ACOL presents itself through the Voice of Jesus. It says that the two Courses work &#x201c;hand-in-hand.&#x201d; Many students of ACIM recognize the Voice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite its name, ACOL does not &#x201c;teach love,&#x201d; for <em>&#x201c;love cannot be taught but only recognized.&#x201d; </em>ACOL leads to the re-discovery our shared heartbeat, a union with One and a relationship with All.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And despite its name as a &#x201c;course,&#x201d; it does not call for effort but for awareness. <em>&#x201c;<em>While you continue to put effort into learning what cannot be learned, as you continue to see yourself as a student seeking to acquire what you do not yet have, you cannot recognize the unity in which you exist.&#x201d;</em></em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>ACOL invites the reader to recover a memory that your heart has never lost. The goal is beyond learning. The goal is direct knowing through realizing one's true identity.</p></p><p>There is a way of knowing that can take you beyond what all your learning has taken you. It can take you to the truth of who you are.Those yearning to access the heart&#39;s knowing will find help here. A Course of Love draws the mind into communion with the heart. It facilitates the dawning of the consciousness of unity--a consciousness that cannot be learned, but only revealed through union and relationship.In this Combined Volume, &#34;The Course&#34; establishes wholeheartedness, an integration of mind and heart. &#34;The Treatises&#34; reveal the &#34;art of thought,&#34; move the reader through the personal self to the true Self, and on to co-creation of a new world. &#34;The Dialogues&#34; offer the transformational experience of The Forty Days and Forty Nights, and a direct relationship with the God within. A Course of Love is an intimate companion on your journey home.</p><h2>The Wesley Challenge Participant Book: 21 Days to a More Authentic Faith</h2><p><p>How can we introduce younger lay people to the practical and accessible Wesley?

In his international bestseller Leading Change, John Kotter revealed why change is so hard, and provided an actionable, eight-step process for implementing successful transformations.

Kotter is Konosuke Matsushita Professor of Leadership, Emeritus, at Harvard Business School, and is widely regarded as the world&#39;s foremost authority on leadership and change. His has been the premier voice on how the best organizations actually do change.Author and international business consultant Kotter (Leading Change, Our Iceberg is Melting) returns with an engaging look at companies that need to overcome a lack of urgency-or a surfeit of complacency-with a proactive agenda. Kotter dissects well his seemingly simple premise, using his professional experiences to examine the inner workings of real companies. Kotter defines his terms with clear language and bullet lists, convincingly asserting that urgency "is not driven by a belief that... everything is a mess but, instead, that the world contains great opportunities and great hazards"; it is, in fact, "a compulsive determination to move, and win, now." Among suggested tactics: bring the outside world into overly insular work teams; make your deeds consistent with your words; view crises as potential opportunities; and disseminate data that "feels interesting, surprising, or dramatic," as opposed to "information so antiseptic that it flows in and out of short-term memory with great speed." Great examples illustrate real-life frustrations and successes, and a special section on dealing with the nay-sayers is full of practical ploys to overcome dissent and kill complacency. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hollywood studios had large stables of contract and stock players from all walks of life and in all shapes, sizes and ages. This great population of personalities formed the league of character actors. They played the sidekicks and best friends of the stars who headlined the movies in which they appeared. They also portrayed parents, grandparents, oddball relatives, wise-cracking neighbors, smart-aleck store clerks and loveable barkeeps. Lest we forget the sinister side of this society, villains also claimed a stake in this assembly of saints, sinners and every type in between. These colorful personalities were usually one-dimensional, someone to whom the star could confide secrets or vent frustrations. In many cases they carried the same persona over from one film to the next, perfecting their stereotype so that audiences knew what to expect from them in a positive and affectionate way, collecting their beloved favorites over the years.The Name Below the Title features 65 of the best and most fun examples of the Hollywood character actor during Hollywood's most famous era from the 1930s through the 1950s.</p><p></p><h2>Catcher with a Glass Arm (Matt Christopher Sports Classics)</h2><p>A young baseball player struggles to overcome his fear of a pitched ball, improve his throwing, and somehow redeem himself in the eyes of his teammates.</p><p>Matt Christopher is the best selling name behind more than 100 sports-themed books for young readers.</p><h2>Out of the Shadows: The New Merchants of Grain</h2><p>In 1979, Dan Morgan, a journalist with the Washington Post, wrote Merchants of Grain, a definitive history of the international grain trade. In the 40 years since Dan&#x2019;s book was published the grain markets have changed almost beyond recognition. So too have the merchants of grain. Once shadowy figures, grain merchants have now come out of the shadows. Almost everything that you eat or drink today will contain something bought, stored, transported, processed, shipped, distributed or sold by one of the seven giants of the agricultural supply chain. The media often refers to them as the ABCD group of international grain-trading companies, with ABCD standing for ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Dreyfus. The acronym, though, ignores the other three giants of the food supply: Glencore, COFCO International and Wilmar. Together, they handle 50 percent of the international trade in grain and oilseeds. In this book&#x2019;s series of exclusive and unprecedented interviews, CEOs and senior traders from these seven giants describe in their own words how the agricultural markets are changing, and how they are adapting to those changes. Accompanying text explains how grain trading works, what grain traders do, and the journey that your food takes before arriving on your plate.This is the inside story of the grain market and of the seven companies at the centre of the world&#x2019;s food supply.</p><p></p><h2>To Be a Jew: A Guide to Jewish Observance in Contemporary Life</h2><p><b>The classic guide to the ageless heritage of Judaism</b><br><br>Embraced over many decades by hundreds of thousands of readers, <i>To Be a Jew</i> offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to traditional Jewish laws and customs as they apply to daily life in the contemporary world.

A mission to cheer up the lonely, thin, increasingly despondent Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador, who had to move away from his house next door to Madeline's in Paris. In their efforts to cheer him up, and for a birthday surprise, Miss Clavel and the girls buy him a retired horse. All is fine until the horse gallops off at the sound of the trumpet to take his place at the head of the queen's Life Guards (his occupation before retiring). As readers whoosh through busy London scenes, we forget the horse has had nothing to eat all day. Upon his return to Pepito's home, he eats everything in sight: "The gardener dropped his garden hose. / There wasn't a daisy or a rose. / 'All my work and all my care / For nought! Oh, this is hard to bear.'" Meanwhile, as the horse is passed out from exhaustion and overeating, Pepito's mother says he has to go. And so Madeline and the others take the horse home with them to Paris, where "They brushed his teeth and gave him bread, / And covered him up / and put him to bed." Ludwig Bemelmans charms us again with the uniquely skewed logic and matter-of-fact madness of childhood that young readers will adore.

Just what the doctor himself&#x2014;oh, snap!&#x2014;would have ordered.&#x201d; &#x2014;M. William Phelps,<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author, <i>Dangerous Ground: My Friendship with a Serial Killer</i><br><br> &#x201c;History is so often compromised by myth-making, exaggerations and half-truths, when the real facts reveal a much more compelling story. Adam Selzer has fleshed out a fascinating and eminently readable portrait of the real H. H. Holmes, the fiendish killer popularly known as the &#x2018;Devil in the White City.&#x2019; Mr. Selzer had dug deep to strip away the fiction in order to give us the accurate and true facts of this shadowy figure&#x2019;s life. The book is an important contribution to our understanding of American criminal history.&#x201d; &#x2014;Richard C. Lindberg, author of <i>Heartland Serial Killers: Belle Gunness, Johann Hoch and Murder for Profit in Gaslight Era Chicago</i>, and sixteen other books.<br><br> &#x201c;Erik Larson brought the serial killer H. H. Holmes to the general reading public&#x2019;s attention in <i>The Devil in the White City</i>. But where Larson leaves off, Adam Selzer picks up, filling in gaps, replacing legend with fact, and debunking myths. From Philadelphia to Chicago, and even down to Texas, Holmes roamed the country in the late Nineteenth Century, leaving behind buried bodies, missing persons, and unanswered questions, in a trail that ultimately led to the gallows. With meticulous research, Selzer digs deep into Holmes&#x2019;s story to tell us not only the &#x201c;how&#x201d; but the &#x201c;why,&#x201d; and he reveals a somewhat unorthodox serial killer by today&#x2019;s standards: a bigamist, a con man, and a swindler who killed indiscriminately, not merely to satisfy some bloodlust but, more practically, to conceal his larceny and deceit. A fascinating read!&#x201d; &#x2014;Mike Farris, author of <i>A Death in the Islands: The Unwritten Law and the Last Trial of Clarence Darrow</i><br><br> &#x201c;When legend becomes fact, print the legend, the saying goes. A case in point is the story of Dr. Herman Webster Mudgett, who became infamous as H.H. Holmes, the depraved supervillain celebrated as the <i>Devil in the White City</i>. If you want the straight dope, and not just the legend about Mudgett/Holmes, read Adam Selzer&#x2019;s <i>H. H. Holmes&#x2014;the True History of the White City Devil</i>. You won't put it down.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dennis L. Breo, co-author of <i>The Crime of the Century&#x2014;Richard Speck and the Murders that Shocked a Nation</i><br><br> &#x201c;Selzer has made a career of fact-checking the most sordid details of Chicago history, disseminating the weird and gritty true history of the city and its most unsavory people through popular mystery tours, a podcast, and books. When the unprecedented success of Erik Larson&#x2019;s <i>Devil in The White City</i> (2003) stirred up renewed interest in serial killer H.H. Holmes, Selzer made it his mission to painstakingly research Holmes&#x2019; life, family, and crimes with intense determination and doggedness. The result is this comprehensive, compelling, and surprising biography of Holmes, written in a conversational style, as if we are passengers on one of Selzer&#x2019;s tours. The book follows every move Holmes ever made, dragging readers all over the country, breathlessly following his trail of deceit and lies. Using thousands of primary sources to draw <b>the most accurate picture of this American villain yet</b>, Selzer keeps the delicate balance of salacious (and mundane) details maintained with solid facts. What emerges is a picture of a terrible but intriguing man, one who continues to capture our imagination over a century later, and one whose story leaps off the page in Selzer&#x2019;s uniquely suited hands. <b>A must-read for fans of The Devil in The White City</b>, of course, but this biography will also hold its own independently in true-crime collections.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>*starred* review &#x201c;In this ... thrilling new biography of H.H. Holmes (1861-1896), who received renewed attention in 2003 when Erik Larson published <i>The Devil in the White City</i>, Mysterious Chicago tour guide and author Selzer (<i>Just Kill Me</i>, 2016, etc.) recharacterizes Holmes as a small-time con man who was likely guilty of a series of murders in Chicago.... A passion for Holmes lore will lead to appreciation for the depth of background and lesser criminal exploits described in great detail.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> &#x201c;Was late 19th-century mass murderer H.H. Holmes motivated more by psychological compulsions than practical concerns? Selzer (<i>Ghost of Chicago</i>) suggests the latter, diverging from the perspective put forth in Erik Larson&#x2019;s <i>The Devil in the White City</i>. He works hard to assemble historical evidence that strays from accounts by Larson, and others, but he never loses sight of the fact that Holmes &#x201c;almost certainly killed at least nine people, ruined the lives of numerous others, and seemed to feel very little guilt about it.&#x201d; This <b>highly readable account</b> of the case walks readers through Holmes&#x2019;s nonviolent crimes before getting to his first murder. Selzer believes that Holmes&#x2019;s 1891 killing of Julia Conner, a woman he had sued for nonpayment of a loan, was, like his others, committed, not out of bloodlust, but as a &#x201c;necessary part of furthering his swindling operations and protecting his lifestyle.&#x201d; <b>He makes a convincing argument</b> that current perceptions of Holmes are not always solidly grounded, even as he concedes that there&#x2019;s &#x201c;a lot of mystery left to be solved&#x201d; about the case, a concession that <b>will lead many aficionados of quality true-crime narrative to monitor his Mysterious Chicago blog for updates</b>.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Guadalupe Mysteries: Deciphering the Code</h2><p><p>Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most beloved symbol of Mexican Catholicism, and devotion to her is widespread in the USA.

In the beginning, Bodine addresses life in heaven, shedding her psychic gleanings on the different "levels" of the soul, starting with level one ("totally self-absorbed") through level five (those who "understand the oneness with all of creation and with God"). From here Bodine enters into discussions on the soul's being sent to earth for birth, or "going back to school." Life is considered "the school on earth." And death is our "graduation." Bodine also speaks to the more familiar experiences of "soul travel" (a.k.a. "out-of-body experiences") and the disassociated and depressed state of "soul loss" (which, she believes, is reparable).<p> Those who don't believe in heaven, angels, and life after death will probably find Bodine's writing hokey and implausible. However, believers will be intrigued by this interestingly packaged and well-written book that attempts to answer the ultimate question: Why am I here? <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p></p><h2>Exodus (Ignatius Catholic Study Bible)</h2><p>Large format, featuring large text size and additional margin space for personal annotations!

It was thought to have been lost over three millennia ago. The books of Gad, Nathan, Ahijah, Shemaiah and Iddo are referred to as &#x201c;The Lost Five.&#x201d; This long-lost book includes two revealing sermons given by King David. We have a prophecy that outlines the end times beginning with the Rapture, the seven-year tribulation and the establishment of Christ&#x2019;s millennial reign. More intriguing than that, it actually reveals who Mystery Babylon is and how it tries to destroy the Jews though a union with Islam, both groups having different replacement theology religions. There are also two discussions on how the Law of Moses views Gentiles. Do they keep the whole Law or not? This book is a real eye-opener for those who are interested in Bible prophecy and Messianic Judaism.

Rather, kids should do <i>nice </i>things for animals, such as bake a drake a cake, or give a mule a pool, and much more. Long out of print, this new edition of <i>Never Tease a Weasel </i>with art by the great <i>New Yorker </i>cartoonist George Booth will surely please a weasel, and everyone else who reads it!</p><p><p>Jean Conder Soule (1925-2015) wrote many books and poems for children in the '60s and '70s. She was so gratified to see an old favorite story of hers come back into print.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 1969, George Booth's illustrations have been an iconic feature of the <i>New Yorker </i>magazine. He also illustrated the classic Dr. Seuss book <i>Wacky Wednesday</i>. He and his wife, Dione, live in Stony Brook, New York.</p>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;Soule's 1964 picture book has been reissued with new illustrations by a New Yorker cartoonist, and the result is a marvelous meld of text and art. The "be kind to animals" lesson is crafted in such slyly humorous terms that it's sure to win universal acceptance, even as it's met with giggles and grins. As a boy and girl tease a weasel in a variety of ways, Soule suggests other ways to makes friends with animals, such as making a goat a coat or giving a mule "a pool/And some jaunty swimming trunks." The animals look appropriately awkward and uncomfortable with these "kindnesses." As Soule observes: "You can knit a kitten mittens,/And perhaps that cat would purr," Booth draws a wide-eyed feline gazing warily from a safe distance at a pair of clunky, oversize mittens. In the end, the children and weasel snuggle on a couch, since: "It's more fun to please a weasel/and be friends with him instead." Soule's zany suggestions beg to be read aloud, and Booth's line drawings with bright daubs of color perfectly capture the lighthearted goings-on. Reminiscent of Judi Barrett's <i>Animals Should Definitely Not Wear Clothing</i> (S &amp; S, 1970), this charmer's inspired silliness will win a wide audience.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He can handle it.' Doesn't anyone remember that Cowardice is my middle name?</i><br><br>Actually, only two other people in the entire world had ever known Trey's real name, and one of them was dead. But Trey didn't have time to think about that. He had a crisis on his hands. He'd just seen two people killed, and others in danger. Maybe he'd been in danger too. Maybe he still was. He and his friends had left the scene of all that death and destruction and total confusion, jumped into a car with an absolute stranger, and rushed off in search of help. They'd driven all night, and now the car had stopped in front of a strange house in a strange place Trey had never been before.<br><br>And Trey's friends actually expected him to take control of the situation.<br><br>"What are you waiting for?" his friend Nina asked. "Just go knock on the door."<br><br> "Why don't you?" Trey asked, which was as good as admitting that he wasn't as brave as a girl. No courage, no pride. Translate that into Latin and it'd be a good personal motto for him. <i>Nulla fortitudo nulla superbia,</i> maybe? Trey allowed himself a moment to drift into nostalgia for the days when his biggest challenges had been figuring out how to translate Latin phrases.<br><br>"Because," Nina said. "You know. Mr. Talbot and I -- well, let's just say I've got a lot of bad memories."<br><br>"Oh," Trey said. And, if he could manage to turn down his fear a notch or two, he did understand. Mr. Talbot, the man they had come to see, had once put Nina through an extreme test of her loyalties. It had been necessary, everyone agreed -- even Nina said so. But it hadn't been pleasant. Mr. Talbot had kept her in prison; he'd threatened her with death.<br><br>Trey was glad he'd never been put through a test like that. He knew: He'd fail.<br><br>Trey glanced up again at the hulking monstrosity of a house where Mr. Talbot lived. He wasn't dangerous, Trey reminded himself. Mr. Talbot was going to be their salvation. Trey and Nina and a few of their other friends had come to Mr. Talbot's so they could dump all their bad news and confusion on him. So he would handle everything, and they wouldn't have to.<br><br>Trey peered toward the front of the car, where his friends Joel and John sat with the driver. Or, technically, the "chauffeur," a word derived from the French. Only the original French word -- <i>chauffer?</i> -- didn't mean "to drive." It meant "to warm" or "to heat" or something like that, because chauffeurs used to drive steam automobiles.<br><br>Not that it mattered. Why was he wasting time thinking about foreign verbs? Knowing French wasn't going to help Trey in the least right now. It couldn't tell him, for example, whether he could trust the driver. Everything would be so easy if he could know, just from one word, whether he could send the driver to knock on Mr. Talbot's door while Trey safely cowered in the car.<br><br> Or how about Joel or John? Granted, they were younger than Trey, and maybe even bigger cowards. They'd never done anything brave. Still -- <br><br>"Trey?" Nina said. <i>"Go!"</i> <br><br>She reached around him and jerked open the door. Then she gave him a little shove on the back, so suddenly that he was surprised to find himself outside the car, standing on his own two feet.<br><br>Nina shut the door behind him.<br><br>Trey took a deep breath. He started to clench his fists out of habit and fear -- a habit of fear, a fear-filled habit -- and only stopped when pain reminded him that he was still clutching the sheaf of papers he'd taken from a dead man's desk. He glanced down and saw a thin line of fresh blood, stark and frightening on the bright white paper.<br><br>Trey's next breath was sharp and panicked. Had someone shot him? Was he in even greater danger than he'd imagined? His ears buzzed, and he thought he might pass out from terror. But nothing else happened, and after a few moments his mind cleared a little.<br><br>He looked at the blood again. It was barely more than a single drop.<br><br><i>Okay,</i> Trey steadied himself. <i>You just had a panic attack over a paper cut. Let's not be telling anybody about that, all right?</i><br><br>A paper cut indoors would have been no big deal. But outdoors -- outdoors, the need to <i>breathe</i> was enough to panic him.<br><br>He forced himself to breathe anyway. And, by sheer dint of will, Trey made himself take a single step forward. And then another. And another.<br><br>Mr. Talbot had a long, long walkway between the street and his house, and the chauffeur had inconveniently parked off to the side, under a clump of trees that practically hid the car from the house. Trey considered turning around, getting back into the car, and telling the chauffeur to pull up closer -- say, onto the Talbots' front porch. But that would mean retracing his steps, and Trey felt like he'd already come so far.<br><br>Maybe even all of three feet.<br><br>With part of his mind, Trey knew he was being foolish -- a total baby, a chicken, a fear-addled idiot.<br><br><i>It's not my fault,</i> Trey defended himself. <i>It's all...conditioning. I can't help the way I was raised.</i> And that was the understatement of the year. For most of his thirteen years, Trey hadn't had control over any aspect of his life. He was an illegal third child -- the entire Government thought he had no right to exist. So he'd had to hide, from birth until age twelve, in a single room. And then, when he was almost thirteen, when his father died...<br><br><i>You don't have time to think about that now,</i> Trey told himself sternly. <i>Walk.</i><br><br>He took a few more steps forward, propelled now by a burning anger that he'd never managed to escape. His mind slipped back to a multiple-choice test question he'd been asking himself for more than a year: <i>Whom do you hate? A) Him; B) Her; C) Yourself?</i> It never worked to add extra choices: <i>(D) All of the above; E) A and B; F) A and C; or G) B and C?</i> Because then the question just became, <i>Whom do you hate the most?</i> <br><br><i>Stop it!</i> Trey commanded himself. <i>Just pretend you're Lee.</i> <br><br>Trey's friend Lee had been an illegal third child like Trey, but Lee had grown up out in the country, on an isolated farm, so he'd been able to spend plenty of time outdoors. He'd almost, Trey thought, grown up normal. As much as Trey feared and hated being outdoors, Lee craved it.<br><br>"How can you stand it?" Trey had asked Lee once. "Why aren't you terrified? Don't you ever think about the danger?"<br><br>"I guess not," Lee had said, shrugging. "When I'm outdoors I look at the sky and the grass and the trees, and I guess that's all I think about."<br><br>Trey looked at the sky and the grass and the trees around him, and all he could think was, <i>Lee should be here, walking up to Mr. Talbot's door, instead of me.</i> Lee had been in the car with Trey and Nina and Joel and John until just about ten minutes earlier. But Lee had had the chauffeur drop him and another boy, Smits, off at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere because, Lee had said, "I have to get Smits to safety."<br><br>Trey suspected that Lee was taking Smits home, to Lee's parents' house, but Trey was trying very hard not to think that. It was too dangerous. Even thinking about it was dangerous.<br><br>And thinking about it made Trey jealous, because Lee still had a home he could go to, and parents who loved him, and Trey didn't.<br><br><i>But Lee would be dead right now if it weren't for me,</i> Trey thought with a strange emotion he barely recognized well enough to name. Pride. He felt proud. And, cowardly Latin motto or no, he had a right to that pride.<br><br>For Trey's act of bravery -- his only one ever -- had been to save Lee's life the night before.<br><br>Beneath the pride was a whole jumble of emotions Trey hadn't had time to explore. He felt his leg muscles tense, as if they too remembered last night, remembered springing forward at the last minute to knock Lee to the side, only seconds before the explosion of glass in the very spot where Lee had stood....<br><br><i>It's easier being brave when you don't have time to think about your other options,</i> Trey thought. <i>Unlike now.</i><br><br>He had so many choices, out here in the open. The ones that called to him most strongly were the ones that involved hiding. How fast would he be able to run back to the car, if he needed to? Would the clump of trees be a good hiding place? Would he be able to squeeze out of sight between that giant flowerpot on the porch and the wall of the Talbot house?<br><br>Trey forced himself to keep walking. It seemed a miracle when he finally reached the front porch. He cast a longing glance toward the flowerpot, but willed himself to stab a finger at the doorbell.<br><br>Dimly, he could hear a somber version of "Westminster Chimes" echoing from indoors. Nobody came. He took a second to admire the brass door knocker, elegantly engraved with the words, GEORGE A. TALBOT, ESQUIRE. Still nobody came.<br><br><i>Too bad,</i> Trey thought. <i>Back to the car, then.</i> But his legs didn't obey. He couldn't face the thought of walking back through all that open space again. He pressed the doorbell again.<br><br>This time the door opened.<br><br>Trey was torn between relief and panic. Relief won when he saw Mr. Talbot's familiar face on the other side of the door. <i>See, this wasn't so bad,</i> Trey told himself. <i>I walked all the way up here without my legs even trembling. Take that, Nina! I am braver than you!</i> <br><br>Trey started thinking about what he was supposed to say to Mr. Talbot. He hadn't worried about that before. Words were so much easier than action.<br><br>"I'm so glad you're home, Mr. Talbot," Trey began. "You won't believe what happened. We just -- "<br><br>But Mr. Talbot cut him off.<br><br>"No, no, I do not want to buy anything to support your school's lacrosse team," he said. "And please do <i>not</i> come back. Tell the rest of your team that this is a no-soliciting house.

In this informative volume, artist Penny Brown expertly explains the materials, learnings and techniques required to produce accurate botanical illustrations. Follow her clear step-by-step instructions and close studies and explorations of the subjects to produce your own illustrations of plants, flowers, vegetables and their myriad parts. The aim of this book is to give you the confidence and enthusiasm to tackle your own projects; to show you how broad a subject botanical drawing is, and how satisfying and enjoyable it can be.<br><br>"Study nature diligently, be guided by nature... for truly art is hidden in nature and he who can draw it out possesses it." - Albrecht D�rer<i></i><br><i></i></p><p>Penny Brown trained and worked as a theatre designer for 10 years before an increasing love of painting and drawing led her to illustration. She works in watercolour, graphite and most recently, cut paper collage. She has illustrated many books on craft, textiles, design, natural history and gardening. She exhibits her botanical paintings and drawings with <i>The Society of Botanical Artists</i> in London, Frankfurt and Spain. She has won several awards including the prestigious <i>President's Prize at The SBA exhibition in 2015</i>. She is also a member of <i>The South West Society of Botanical Artists</i> in the UK, and opens her studio regularly for art weeks. She looks forward to continuing her parallel careers in botanical art and illustration.<br>http://www.soc-botanical-artists.org/artist/penny-brown/Botanical drawing differs from most other types of art by its emphasis on accuracy. Beautiful illustrations of this type have adorned pages in herbals and books on botany for centuries. This useful primer shows the artist how to go about producing this type of work through projects and using easily obtainable materials. Graphite pencils are the tools you require to tackle the two exercises and ten projects in this book. A nice touch is that everything in the book is drawn using them, including the pictures of what you need to buy. This is not much (you probably already own most of it), so you can start straight away by organizing your workspace and then &#34;taking a line for a walk&#34; and getting limbered up for some drawing. Learn about tone and various mark-making techniques such as cross-hatching, and look at a drawing where each pencil type (H to 2B) has been labelled. Each project is very thorough, showing in captioned stages how to first draw the outline and then add the shading and other details. The author encourages the student to observe carefully, and to this end there is a short section on plant structure, including labelled diagrams and information about gathering subjects for drawing. Subjects for the projects include fruit and vegetables as well as grasses and flowers so a wide range of shapes and plant types are covered. Topics as diverse as composition, working in the field or from photographs and plenty of good advice in the form of &#34;field notes&#34; are all covered. Anybody keen on having a go at this type of work ought to find this book useful, although it is not a volume for total beginners on how to draw; rather it is aimed at the artist who wants to try something new and already knows the basics. A good grounding in a subject sparsely covered in art primers. * myshelf.com * March 2018 Artist, Penny Brown, brings us a brand new step-by-step guide to drawing flowers, vegetables, fruit and other plant life in Botanical Drawing.

Pete has just won a contest, and the prize is a school visit from none other than M. T. Graves, Pete's idol and the bestselling author of the FleshCrawlers series. He's even going to stay with the Monroes while he's visiting! Harold and Howie are thrilled, but Chester the cat is suspicious. Why does Graves dress all in black? Why doesn't the beady-eyed crow perched on his shoulder say anything? Why has a threatening flock of crows invaded the backyard? And most worrisome of all: In each of the FleshCrawlers books, <i>why does something bad always happen to the pets?</i> Suddenly, Graves's interest in all of the animals -- especially Bunnicula -- looks far from innocent. It's up to Chester, Harold, and Howie to find out if M. T. Graves and Edgar Allan Crow are really devising a plot to make their beloved bunny. . . NEVERMORE.</p><p>James Howe&nbsp;is the author of more than ninety books for young readers.&nbsp;<i>Bunnicula</i>, coauthored by his late wife Deborah and published in 1979, is considered a modern classic of children&#x2019;s literature. The author has written six highly popular sequels, along with the spinoff series&nbsp;Tales from the House of Bunnicula&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bunnicula and Friends.&nbsp;Among his other books are picture books such as <i>Horace and Morris but Mostly Dolores&nbsp;</i>and beginning reader series that include the Pinky and Rex and Houndsley and Catina books.

The family's well-known animals, "vampire" rabbit Bunnicula, cat Chester, dog Harold, and puppy Howie, go into high alert over the impending visitor and the strange happenings that accompany him. Why would the mysterious caped man want Bunnicula to sleep in his room with him? Why does a murder of crows arrive in the yard at the same moment M.T. arrives? Patrick Mulvahill relishes the relationships between the animals and humans as much as James Howe does. The cat-and-dog snits and the exuberance of puppy Howie are particularly fun, as is the tongue-in-cheek humor. Sleuths, be prepared to solve the mystery and laugh simultaneously.

Then another. And another. It was everything she could do to keep from dropping to her knees in the mud and giving up. But that was the last thing any of them could afford.</p><p>It was the second huge storm in a week. The first had crashed their fifty-foot sailboat, the<i> Lucky Star,</i> onto the rocky shore of this tiny island. Now another one had come along and dragged the boat&#x2014;their only shelter&#x2014;back out to sea. The four of them had been lucky to get off alive as they&#x2019;d scrambled over the rocks, onto the beach, and up into the jungle.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep moving! And stay together!&#x201d; she shouted to the others. Her voice was already hoarse, trying to be heard over the wind, and thunder, and crashing waves. She held her flashlight out in front of her, but it was hard to see. The rain poured down in sheets, even under the jungle&#x2019;s thick canopy of trees.</p><p>They moved in a tight clump, holding on to one another and to the few things they&#x2019;d managed to take. Jane and Buzz stayed close on either side. Carter was right behind, pushing the group to go faster. Behind them, Vanessa could hear the tide pounding the shore, each wave a little higher than the one before it. If they didn&#x2019;t keep heading uphill, it was going to be one of them who got washed away next.</p><p>&#x201c;I think I dropped something!&#x201d; Jane called.</p><p>&#x201c;Leave it!&#x201d; Vanessa told her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stop!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said leave it!&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t like yelling at Jane, even now, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. The only thing that mattered was finding shelter. And that meant getting to the caves as fast as possible.</p><p>The island was run through with them, like some kind of giant underground maze. The closest cavern opening they&#x2019;d found was only a minute&#x2019;s walk up from the beach. But that was during the day, and in the light. Now the cave seemed impossibly far off as they shuffled along, tripping over roots and rocks and squinting through the heaviest downpour Vanessa had ever seen.</p><p>&#x201c;Just keep moving!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay! It&#x2019;s going to be&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The words caught in her throat with a sob. The truth was, Vanessa had no idea if it was going to be okay or not. How was a thirteen-year-old supposed to handle something like this? Still, Buzz and Carter were eleven, and Jane was only nine. Without any parents or other adults around, it was up to her to keep the three younger ones safe for as long as possible. That much Vanessa knew.</p><p>But knowing it and doing it were two very different things.</p><p>Carter gritted his teeth. It wasn&#x2019;t as if Vanessa, Buzz, or Jane could see him in the dark, but he knew he had to stay strong. This wasn&#x2019;t a place where you could let your guard down, even for a second.</p><p>As they trudged uphill, he kept one hand on his little sister&#x2019;s shoulder and another on the pillowcase he&#x2019;d used as a makeshift pack. It was heavy with the fire axe from the <i>Lucky Star</i>, along with some sea charts and whatever else he&#x2019;d scooped off the galley table in the dark. There hadn&#x2019;t been time to pick and choose. They&#x2019;d taken whatever they could before the boat was swept away. Everything else was lost.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cold wind off the Pacific seemed to cut right through his soaking-wet clothes. He couldn&#x2019;t stop shivering&#x2014;and neither could Jane. If there was any good news, it was that the ground had started to level off underfoot. That meant they were getting close.</p><p>Sure enough, with the next flash of lightning, Carter saw just ahead a familiar rock wall and the arched black opening of the cave itself. It was huge, maybe two stories high and wide enough for a truck to turn around inside. It wouldn&#x2019;t be any warmer in there, but at least it would be dry.</p><p>&#x201c;Straight ahead! Did you see that?&#x201d; he shouted.</p><p>No one answered, but they all picked up their pace. The small beam of Vanessa&#x2019;s flashlight led the way across the last twenty yards of flat muddy ground.</p><p>As they passed under the rock overhang and into the cave&#x2019;s entrance, Carter felt the rain lighten to a sprinkle, then down to nothing at all. Finally, a break. Vanessa, Jane, and Buzz all sank to the ground, heaving for breath in the dark.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep going!&#x201d; Carter said. The wind was still bad at the front of the cave. There was no sense stopping now.</p><p>&#x201c;Give us a second,&#x201d; Vanessa told him.</p><p>&#x201c;Just a little farther,&#x201d; Carter said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s freezing right here!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you guys?&#x201d; Jane said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s freezing everywhere. Calm down!&#x201d; Vanessa said. Even now, she had to be the boss. It was like she couldn&#x2019;t help it.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>You</i> calm down!&#x201d; Carter snapped, just before Jane cut them both off.</p><p>&#x201c;You guys&#x2014;<i>listen!</i>&#x201d; she said, louder than before. The urgency in her voice was unmistakable.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Buzz asked.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something in here,&#x201d; Jane said.</p><p>Carter ducked his head to listen. The rain outside poured down, but the sounds in the cave seemed to bounce off one another and amplify. And that&#x2019;s when he heard it. A soft rustling of some kind was coming from deeper inside. Something was moving around back there. It sent a fresh wave of goose bumps down his arms.</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone get up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. slowly,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Vanessa, you got the light?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; she said. She&#x2019;d turned off the flashlight to save the batteries, but she clicked it back on now. The beam shook unsteadily as she played it across the cave walls.</p><p>Then, before the light could show them anything, a piercing scream broke out of the darkness. For a split second, Carter thought it was Jane&#x2014;but she was right there next to him. The sound was farther away than that. And in fact, he realized, it hadn&#x2019;t been a human voice at all. It was an animal.</p><p>He and Vanessa looked at each other.</p><p>&#x201c;Run!&#x201d; Vanessa shouted.</p><p>As she turned to go, she tripped and fell. The flashlight dropped out of her hand. In the next moment they were all thrown into inky pitch blackness&#x2014;just as Carter spotted the shadow of something on four legs bolting straight at them from the back of the cave.</p><p>And behind it were several others, all screaming as they came.</p><p>Something big slammed into Jane as it ran past her in the dark. It sent a shock wave of pain through her arm. Her hand slipped out of Carter&#x2019;s, and she spun around as she fell, scraping her knees and palms over the rocky ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Carter!&#x201d; she yelled.</p><p>&#x201c;Jane? Where are you?&#x201d;</p><p>It was impossible to see through the darkness, much less to try to reach her brother. The stampede of beasts&#x2014;whatever they were&#x2014;pounded all around them now. Jane could feel their feet thudding on either side of her. She tried to crawl away toward the wall on one side just as one of them raced by. She then moved in the opposite direction, only to be knocked to the ground a second time. There was nowhere to go. All she could do was curl into a ball with her knees drawn up tight, and hope not to get completely trampled.</p><p>The worst part was the noise. Even with her hands over her ears, it filled Jane&#x2019;s head&#x2014;a humanlike, squealing sound straight out of a horror movie. It seemed to go on and on, echoing off the cave walls and high ceiling. She let out a scream of her own, but it only mixed in with the others until she couldn&#x2019;t hear herself at all.</p><p>Then, as quickly as it had begun, the sounds faded. The thudding feet grew softer. The squealing came from outside now, and trailed off into the night.</p><p>Jane&#x2019;s heart was still pounding when she moved her hands away from her ears and tried to look around.</p><p>&#x201c;Carter?&#x201d; she said again. &#x201c;Vanessa? Buzz?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Carter answered. He was closer than she&#x2019;d realized. Somehow that made her feel a little better. &#x201c;Is everyone okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; Buzz said, though his voice sounded shaky.</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Vanessa answered. Jane could sense them all crawling toward her, feeling their way, but it was impossible to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the flashlight?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>A few soft clicking noises came from nearby. And then, &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s broken,&#x201d; Vanessa answered.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t like any darkness Jane had ever experienced at home. Not like when she turned off her bedside light to go to sleep at night. At least then, you could see your hand in front of your face. Here, the only comfort at all came from the sound of the others&#x2019; voices. As soon as Carter found her, she wrapped her arms around him and held on tight. She squeezed her eyes shut in the dark, trying to cut off the tears, but they wouldn&#x2019;t stop. After everything that had just happened, it was hard not to wonder, <i>What else? What next?</i></p><p>Vanessa and Buzz were close behind. They clustered in tightly now with Carter and Jane. All four of them were still shaking badly.</p><p>&#x201c;What were those things, anyway?&#x201d; Carter asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Wild boars,&#x201d; Jane answered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they had to be.&#x201d;</p><p>She&#x2019;d seen pictures of them back home, and even a video about boar hunting in the South Pacific. The boars were like wild pigs, big and strong with tusks and sharp teeth. It was lucky none of them had been hurt, or completely trampled. Jane shivered with the thought of what could have happened.</p><p>&#x201c;They were probably trying to get out of the storm, too,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet we took their spot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What if they want it back?&#x201d; Buzz asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope they don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Carter answered. There wasn&#x2019;t much to say to that. All they could really do now was stick close together, wait for daylight, and hope for the best.</p><p>As Jane hunkered in with the others, teeth chattering in the dark, wet clothes sticking to her skin, it all started to sink in. These last three days on the island had been the worst of her life, by far. The worst of <i>any</i> of their lives. They&#x2019;d barely had enough food, and they&#x2019;d practically killed themselves finding water. So far, there had been no sign of rescue, and no way of knowing if help was coming anytime soon. Or at all. It had been just the four of them living alone on the wreck of the <i>Lucky Star.</i></p><p>Now even the boat was gone, along with the last of their food and almost everything else they&#x2019;d had on board. All of which could mean only one thing. Their lives here were about to get harder.</p><p>Much, much harder.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p></p><p>The rain stopped sometime just before dawn.</p><p>Buzz was the first to notice. It was the sound that changed. The wind died down first, and then the steady drumbeat of the rain itself. Finally, the darkness lifted, and the shape of the cave&#x2019;s mouth started to show in the very earliest morning light.</p><p>Carter, Vanessa, and Jane were sitting with their heads drooped, half awake. None of them had slept, not really, but they didn&#x2019;t seem ready to get up and move yet, either.</p><p>Still, nature called. Buzz had been holding on for what felt like hours. After the run-in with the boars, who knew what else might be waiting out there?</p><p>But the rocks dug into his back no matter how he sat, and his damp clothes had kept him shivering through the night. It was crazy how cold it got here after dark, considering how hot it was during the day. He&#x2019;d never been this cold in his life, not even during the worst Chicago winters back home.</p><p>Finally, he got up, stretched his aching body, and stepped outside.</p><p></p></p><h2>Halo: Retribution</h2><p>An original full-length novel set in the Halo universe and based on the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling video game series!<br><br>December 2553.

She lives in Amarillo, Texas.<b><p></p></b>Gr 9 Up&#x2014;The sequel to Splintered (Abrams, 2013) continues the adventures of Alyssa Gardner, a descendent of Alice Liddell, Lewis Caroll's inspiration for Alice and Wonderland, who has inherited her ancestor's connection to Wonderland, and her madness. Alyssa is back up from the rabbit hole but still not safe. Having made the decision to renounce her title as Queen of Wonderland to live in the human world with her boyfriend, Jeb, she is still enticed by the mysterious netherling Morpheus to return to the magical realm, or otherwise it will be destroyed. Much to Alyssa's horror, Morpheus manages to come to the human world and even enroll in her school. Fans will be pleased that Morpheus plays a more prominent role in this book, since he is more intriguing as a romantic figure than Jeb. Alyssa's mother, newly released from a mental institution, is also given a larger role, and the teen's relationship with both parents is fleshed out. Like Alyssa's half-mad, half-sane world, this installment feels unbalanced at times, but stays entertaining. The cliff-hanger ending will leave readers eager for the next entry in the series.&#x2014;Eliza Langhans, Hatfield Public Library, MA</p><h2>Hike It Baby: 100 Awesome Outdoor Adventures with Babies and Toddlers</h2><p>New parents and parents of toddlers face unique challenges when it comes to planning outdoor trips. &#x201c;Family-friendly trail&#x201d; is often a misleading phrase, and doesn&#x2019;t take young children under the age of 5 into consideration, whose safety and comfort require a different perspective.

A kangaroo has a mother. Just like me and you." Tremendously popular author/illustrator Eric Carle needs no introduction. Readers wait eagerly for every new picture book--and nobody will be disappointed with this one. In this Very Simple story, an unseen child asks variations on the same question: "Does a lion/monkey/dolphin have a mother, too?" The response is always the same: a big colorful "YES!" with the soothing reassurance that, "like me and you," everyone has a mother. Repetition is the name of the game, here, because nothing comforts like reiteration.<p> Those on the verge of reading will enjoy the question and answer format, which is clearly designed to be read aloud. A list of the names of animal babies, parents, and groups is included--did you know that a group of bears is called a "sloth"? Or that a group of foxes is a "skulk"? Carle's trademark collages are as colorful and luminous as those found in any of his other well-loved modern classics (including <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and <i>The Very Quiet Cricket</i>); as usual, the illustrations are so good they're worthy of framing.

Repetition of key phrases helps preschoolers take the first step toward reading readiness. And the game-like format makes it easy and fun to discover more about the world of nature and to learn the common names of some familiar - and some not so familiar - animals. A bonus page at the back of the book lists the correct but sometimes surprising names of animal babies, their parents, and groups.</p><p> Eric Carle is the creator of many beloved picture books for very small children. Here he offers a beautiful way for parents and children to share the knowledge that love crosses all boundaries and ties all creatures on this earth together.</p><p> Ages 2-4</p></p><h2>Shibari: Everything you want to know about Japanese bondage. Guide in pictures.</h2><p>Welcome to the beginners guide to Shibari. In this book you will learn about what it takes to safely and confidently perform the Japanese art of Shibari otherwise known as bondage. The secret here is that not all bondage is sexual in nature. While it is obviously associated with that as well, it is also independently considered an art form and is practiced by very serious artists. The main difference is being in the word chosen to describe it. The word Shibari in Japanese is specific to the act of tying, or binding. Whereas Kinbaku is the more sexual side of it, the word associated the BDSM and sex games side of things. If you are referring to a beautiful artistic display that, while erotic, is limited to an artist&#x2019;s interpretation and not a sex act then you would be speaking of Shibari. <p><b>Here is a preview of what you'll learn:</b></p> - What is Shibari? - Materials for the Japanese art of Shibari - Knotting and Tying - The knot tying of hands &#x201c;stirrup&#x201d; - The tying of hands &#x201c;stirrup&#x201d; (another variation) - The wrist knot &#x201c;chain&#x201d; - The knotting under arm &#x201c;rat-tail stopper&#x201d; - Connecting neck with both arms &#x201c;common whipping&#x201d; - Leg bind &#x201c;round lashing&#x201d; - Hip tie &#x201c;square lashing&#x201d; - Ankle&#x2019;s tying - Chest knots - Chest bind &#x201c;figure 8 knot&#x201d; - Chest bind &#x201c;figure 8 knot&#x201d; with hands - Advanced Knotting &amp; Tying - The rope tying of hands, shoulders and legs - Double loops to tie mid arm mark &#x201c;bowline&#x201d; - The tying &#x201c;fisherman&#x2019;s knot&#x201d; - Sturdy knot of body &#x201c;overhand bow&#x201d; - The tying neck &amp; back &#x201c;common cross whipping&#x201d; - The tying &#x201c;cow hitch&#x201d; - &#x201c;Constrictor knot&#x201d; - Humble coin knot &#x201c;double overhand&#x201d; - The tying &#x201c;ashley stopper knot&#x201d; - Difficult tying of waist, legs and head - The knotting rope</p><p></p><h2>The Invisibles Book One</h2><p>One of Grant Morrison's most controversial, trippiest and abstract comic book titles!

Since then, his career has been a nonstop success story, with blockbuster movies like <em>Back to the Future</em>, <em>The Secret of My Success</em>, <em>Doc Hollywood</em>, and the lead voice in Disney's <em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</em>. He retired from his award-winning role on <em>Spin City</em>. Michael has won numerous awards, including four Golden Globes, four Emmys, two Screen Actors Guild awards, <em>GQ</em> Man of the Year, and the People's Choice award. He actively lobbies for stem cell research around the country and is very visible in raising money for Parkinsons research with the Michael J. Fox Foundation.At the beginning of ALWAYS LOOKING UP, Michael J. Fox takes note of the &#34;struts&#34; of his life--work, politics, faith, and family--and explains that his memoir is, in a way, thematic, rather than a chronology of the last 10 years. In a familiar, but somewhat changed, voice he recounts the major shifts in his life, which include leaving his acting career, creating the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#39;s Research, advocating for PD research, and coping with the disease itself, which has been tyrannical of recent years. However, PD is also a source of Fox&#39;s optimism--which the listener can clearly hear in his poignant and impassioned delivery. While Fox shares many realities, he also offers hope--which he calls &#34;informed optimism.&#34; There&#39;s much to be learned and aspire to here.

The emphsis here in on the control of the mind through concentration and meditation. Raja yoga is also called the yoga of meditation. It is regarded as the psychological way to union with God. Rousing the Kundalini is the one and only way to attain Divine Wisdom. The rousing may come in various ways: through love for God, through the mercy of perfected sages, or through the power of the analytic will of the philosopher. Wherever there was any manifestation of what is ordinarily called supernatural power or wisdom, there a little current of Kundalini must have found its way into the Sushumna. Only, in the vast majority of such cases, the people had ignorantly stumbled on some practice which set free a minute portion of the coiled-up Kundalini. All worship, consciously or unconsciously, leads to this end. The man who thinks that he is receiving response to his prayers does not know that the fulfillment comes from his own nature, that he has succeeded by the mental attitude of prayer in waking up a bit of this infinite power which is coiled up within himself. Thus, what people ignorantly worship under various names, through fear and tribulation, the Yogi declares to the world to be the real power coiled up in every being, the Mother of eternal happiness, if we but know how to approach her. And Raja Yoga is the science of religion, the rationale of all worship, all prayers, forms, ceremonies, and miracles.</p><p><b>Excerpt:<br></b> Rousing the Kundalini is the one and only way to attain Divine Wisdom.

Printed on heavy card stock, Ball's painted portraits are big and bright enough to draw even younger children but the appeal will be strictly ephemeral and next to the oldie but goodie Dinosaur Mix-Up (Starlight Editions, 1990), the number of possible choices here is downright paltry." <i>School Library Journal</i> <br> <br>"The simple but clever design of this book splits each cardboard page into three segments, chopping 10 different dinosaurs into fronts, middles, and backs to be mixed and matched at will.

(Bruce Locksmith <i>Amazon</i> 2005-11-03)<br><br>5 Star Review for the 6th Edition: "Great book and very detailed in labeling and diagramming the internal mechanisms of a 'Typical' Home door lock. This book was a good refresher on some techniques. I mainly got this book to get a better understanding of how to open door locks more efficiently with power tools, and be more aware of the variety of locks available out there. Just because a certain lock is outdated doesn't mean it's no longer in use. Some people are resistant to changing their locks, and the longer they keep their old locks means lock smiths need to have a good variety of knowledge of all the locks out there in circulation. A great book to read. Its spread out like a physics textbook starting off with vectors and then bringing you into the meat of the lock. No actual physics math required, but some knowledge on torque is a must. LOVE THIS BOOK."

In China the story of liberation and the revolution that followed is not one of peace, liberty, and justice. It is first and foremost a story of calculated terror and systematic violence." So begins Frank Dik�tter's stunning and revelatory chronicle of Mao Zedong's ascension and campaign to transform the Chinese into what the party called New People.<br> Following the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, after a bloody civil war, Mao hoisted the red flag over Beijing's Forbidden City, and the world watched as the Communist revolution began to wash away the old order. Due to the secrecy surrounding the country's records, little has been known before now about the eight years that followed, preceding the massive famine and Great Leap Forward.</p><p>Drawing on hundreds of previously classified documents, secret police reports, unexpurgated versions of leadership speeches, eyewitness accounts of those who survived, and more, <i>The Tragedy of Liberation</i> bears witness to a shocking, largely untold history. Interweaving stories of ordinary citizens with tales of the brutal politics of Mao's court, Frank Dik�tter illuminates those who shaped the "liberation" and the horrific policies they implemented in the name of progress. People of all walks of life were caught up in the tragedy that unfolded, and whether or not they supported the revolution, all of them were asked to write confessions, denounce their friends, and answer queries about their political reliability. One victim of thought reform called it a "carefully cultivated Auschwitz of the mind." Told with great narrative sweep, <i>The Tragedy of Liberation </i>is a powerful and important document giving voice at last to the millions who were lost, and casting new light on the foundations of one of the most powerful regimes of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><b>Frank Dik�tter</b> is chair professor of humanities at the University of Hong Kong. Before moving to Asia in 2006, he was professor of the modern history of China at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He has published nine books on the history of China, including <i>Mao's Great Famine</i>, which won the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction in 2011. He lives in Hong Kong.<p>"A brilliant and powerful account of the formation of that society . . . Nobody who reads about the cost of the establishment of the PRC in Dikotter&#x2019;s humane and lucid prose will find much sympathy for the authoritarian case.

Dik�tter performs here a tremendous service by making legible the hugely controversial origins of the present Chinese political order" - Tim Snyder</p><p>"A history of early Maoist China puts paid to any notion of a &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; . . . In <i>The Tragedy of Liberation</i> . . . Frank Dikotter convincingly demolishes this rosy assessment of the early People&#x2019;s Republic . . . The book is a remarkable work of archival research. Dikotter rarely, if ever, allows the story of central government to dominate by merely reporting a top-down directive. Instead, he tracks down the grassroots impact of Communist policies &#x2013; on farmers, factory workers, industrialists, students, monks &#x2013; by mining archives and libraries for reports, surveys, speeches and memoirs. In so doing, he uncovers astonishing stories of party-led inhumanity and also popular resistance . . . Dikotter sustains a strong human dimension to the story by skilfully weaving individual voices through the length of the book" - <i>Financial Times</i></p><p>"This groundbreaking book examines the bloodstained reality behind the word and reveals how it brought tragedy to millions. Frank Dikotter is already the author of a revelatory book about China&#x2019;s great famine of 1958-62, and in this prequel &#x2013; unsparing in its detail, relentless in its research, unforgiving in its judgments &#x2013; he deals in the same way with the Chinese revolution from 1945 to 1957 . . . This exhaustive trawl through Chinese archives charts the full cost of those early years of change . . . Dikotter&#x2019;s achievement in this book is remarkable. He has mastered a mass of original source material, and has done so by mining local archives in China, which have yielded up a host of treasures. (Significantly, scholars are now reporting the steady closure of official records, as local bureaucrats revert to old habits of secrecy and isolation. This may be the last work of its kind for a while.) . . . Staggering amount of detail . . . For many years, histories of China have treated the 1950s as if the decade was an interlude of reason. That belief does not survive contact with this book . . . It is clear to this reviewer, at least, that mainstream academic scholarship must also be revised in the light of Dikotter&#x2019;s work. In particular, volume 14 of the Cambridge History of China, which covers the period of this book, will have to be rewritten" - <i>Sunday Times</i></p><p>"Path-breaking . . . Some of what Dikotter describes has been known in general terms, but what he has done here &#x2013; as when he was writing about the later famine &#x2013; is take advantage of the opening of archives in which firsthand official reports and accounts of death in all its forms, together with the myriad other forms of Maoist horror, can now be read unedited. It will be increasingly difficult for Western China specialists to write with authority based only on previous Western publications or on Chinese public statements. We remain in Frank Dikotter&#x2019;s debt" - <i>Literary Review</i></p><p>"With a mixture of passion and ruthlessness, he marshals the facts, many of them recently unearthed in party archives. Out of these, Mr Dikotter constructs a devastating case for how extreme violence, not a moral mandate, was at the heart of how the party got to power, and of how it then governed . . . He was ready to lead the country into the giant experiment of the Great Leap Forward. Mr Dikotter has already written about that in &#x201c;Mao&#x2019;s Great Famine&#x201d;, which this book only betters. The final volume of his planned trilogy will be on the Cultural Revolution, bringing the curtain down on a truly disastrous period" - <i>Economist</i></p><p>"Frank Dikotter&#x2019;s powerful new book is a bold and startling attempt to rectify this apparent neglect.

But there's little on his legendary speech and how he came to write it. Find out more in this gripping book with illustrations by Caldecott Medalist Jerry Pinkney.</b></b><br><br>Martin Luther King, Jr. was once asked if the hardest part of preaching was knowing where to begin. No, he said. The hardest part is knowing where to end. "It's terrible to be circling up there without a place to land."<br>Finding this place to land was what Martin Luther King, Jr. struggled with, alongside advisors and fellow speech writers, in the Willard Hotel the night before the March on Washington, where he gave his historic "I Have a Dream" speech. But those famous words were never intended to be heard on that day, not even written down for that day, not even once.<br><br>Barry Wittenstein teams up with legendary illustrator Jerry Pinkney to tell the story of how, against all odds, Martin found his place to land.</p><p>Barry Wittenstein is the author of several picture books, including<i> Waiting for Pumpsie</i> and<i> The Boo-Boos That Changed the World: A True Story About an Accidental Invention (Really)</i>. He is pursuing a Masters in Childhood Education at Hunter College and lives in New York City.<br><br>Legendary author and illustrator Jerry Pinkney's many accolades include the Caldecott Medal, five Coretta Scott King Awards, five Coretta Scott King Honor Awards, four New York Times Best Illustrated Books, and four gold medals from the Society of Illustrators. He served on the National Council of the Arts, is a Trustee Emeritus of the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, and has taught at Pratt Institute, the University of Delaware, and the University of Buffalo. He lives in Westchester, New York.&#x2605; "Wittenstein's free-verse narrative perfectly captures the tension leading up to the speech as each adviser urged his own ideas while remaining a supportive community. Pinkney's trademark illustrations dramatize this and the speech, adding power and further illuminating the sense of historical importance. Gives readers a fresh and thrilling sense of what it took to make history."<b><i> &#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</i>, Starred Review</b> <br><br> &#x2605; "The urgency of the text, underscored by boldface type marking the relentless passing of the hours, is complemented beautifully by Pinkney's more contemplative art. The loose-lined pencil and watercolor-washed illustrations often include emotionally resonant background portraits of people who inspired King as he composed the speech. Collage elements are incorporated brilliantly, from scraps of newspapers, maps, and hotel wallpaper to torn photos of relevant landmarks (the White House; Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church). . . . This is essential American history, distilled into one of the most powerful picture books of the year." &#x2014;<b><i>The Horn Book, </i>Starred Review</b> <br><b><br></b> &#x2605; "Wittenstein&#x2019;s free verse, beautifully subdued, flows crisp and clear, leaving room for Pinkney to shine. Collage artwork gives the impression of torn fabric&#x2014;a striking metaphor&#x2014;with holes being patched by old photographs of hymnals, maps, marchers, and flags, adding texture and tension to the expressive pencil and watercolor renderings."&#x2014;<b><i>Booklist</i>, Starred Review</b> <br><b><br></b>&#x2605; "Wittenstein's riveting story shows that historical moments&#x2014;and movements&#x2014;are not inevitable; they're shaped and changed by many hands and voices. In emphatic phrases and art alternatingly warm and tense, the creators' moving portrait of the civil rights leader in consultation with others is an invaluable addition to the shelf of King biographies." &#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly, </i>Starred Review</b><br><br> &#x2605; "Wittenstein's straightforward, informative text conveys both the urgency of King's words and the weight of his responsibility as a social justice icon, but does not compromise the sobering reality of the country's racial unrest in 1963. Pinkney's warm illustrations are reminiscent of courtroom sketches, transporting readers into the historic moment. . . . Wittenstein and Pinkney's collaboration is an evocative study in King's speechwriting process. A work that takes a familiar topic and shapes it into a moving portrait of �undeterred determination and conviction."&#x2014;<b><i>School Library Journal</i>, Starred Review</b><br><br> "'We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers,' declared Bayard Rustin in the late 1940s. A proponent of nonviolent resistance and a stalwart figure in the civil rights movement, Rustin organized a profound and peaceful milestone in American history &#x2014; the 1963 March on Washington.&nbsp;'A Place to Land'&nbsp;(Holiday House, ages 7 to 10), written by Barry Wittenstein, focuses on the way Martin Luther King Jr. crafted and delivered his&nbsp;'I Have a Dream'&nbsp;speech 56 years ago this August. The opening pages feature King in the Willard Hotel lobby with Rustin and eight other advisers, debating the content of the speech the night before the march. The rest of the book, illustrated with enormous heart and rich textures by Jerry Pinkney, presents Dr. King's inspiring words as part of an outsize pageant, featuring King, the crowds and others on the stage, including Mahalia Jackson, who urged King, 'Tell them about the dream!'"&#x2014;<b><i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><h2>Mentor Like Jesus: His Radical Approach to Building the Church</h2><p>The church needs sold-out, all-in Jesus-followers.

He is currently leading his 16th mentoring group and has now personally invested in 128 men and indirectly, in their marriages and families.

PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;Imagination grows and spreads from the fertile pages of this book to the minds of young readers. Henkes's familiar illustration style invites children into a most unusual garden. It never needs weeding, the flowers are ever-blooming, and colors change just by thinking of them (even into patterns). "In my garden, rabbits wouldn't eat the lettuce because the rabbits would be chocolate and I would eat them." Jelly beans would grow on bushes. Tomatoes would be the size of beach balls, but "carrots would be invisible because I don't like carrots!" Intense pastel colors and soft navy outlines bring the perfect garden to life. Colors splash across the pages, matching the enthusiasm of the text. The vibrancy and size of the artwork make this an excellent choice for groups, large or small.

From the air, they see Manhattan streets, docks, an airport, tourist attractions, and Rosalba's father's office. The simple text could be enjoyed as a read-aloud or as a read-alone for newly independent readers. What makes the book so interesting is Dorros's integration of Spanish words and phrases via Abuela's dialogue within the English text. While some phrases are translated by the child, others will be understood in context. As insurance, a glossary, which provides definitions and pronunciations, is appended. The illustrations sing out a celebration of the love and joy that underlies the brief, straightforward narrative. Combining vibrant watercolor and pastel images with interesting snippets of collage in an exuberant folk-art style, Kleven depicts the adventurous, warm-hearted Abuela and the jazzy, colorful topography of an energetic, multiethnic city. Thoughtful design extends to the endpapers featuring cloud formations that cleverly echo many images from the story. While not bilingual in the strictest sense, this book is a less self-conscious, more artfully natural approach to multicultural material. It should prove useful not only for collections in which there is need for ethnic diversity, but also as enrichment for intellectually curious children who are intrigued by the exploration of another language. --Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Greenwich, CT<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Experiencing the Presence of God: Teachings from the Book of Hebrews</h2><p><b>"True and absolute freedom is only found in the presence of God."--A.W.

Despite the bond they share in the Force, after three years of marriage the Jedi Master and his wife are still learning the ropes of being a couple&#x2014;and struggling to find time together between the constant demands of duty. But all that will change when they&#x2019;re united on an unexpected mission&#x2014;and must pool their exceptional skills to combat an insidious enemy . . . and salvage a part of Jedi history.<br><br>It begins with a message from a surprising source: Nirauan, the planet where Thrawn, dangerous disciple of Emperor Palpatine, once held sway . . . and from which Luke and Mara barely escaped with their lives. The message itself is shocking. After fifty years, the remains of Outbound Flight&#x2014;a pioneering Jedi expedition viciously destroyed by Thrawn&#x2014;have been found on Nirauan. Now, the fiercely honor-bound aliens who reside there wish to turn over the remnants of the doomed mission to the New Republic.

But it may also mean something more . . . something that has stirred an inexplicable sense of foreboding in Mara.<br><br>Whatever may await, the Skywalkers will not face it alone.

The conversation sounded worried, too, as worried as he himself felt.<br><br>Though for entirely different reasons. For him, this was a personal matter, the frustration of a professional dealing with fallible beings and the capriciousness of a universe that refused to always live up to one&#x2019;s preconceived notions as to what was fitting and proper. An error had been made, possibly a very serious error. And as with all errors, there would likely be unpleasant consequences riding in its wake.<br><br>From the starboard crew pit came a muffled curse, and he stifled a grimace. None of that mattered to the Star Destroyer&#x2019;s crew. Their worries stemmed solely from their performance, and whether they would be facing a pat on the back or a boot in the rear at journey&#x2019;s end.<br><br>Or possibly they were merely worried about the sublight engines blowing up. On this ship, one never knew.<br><br>He shifted his attention downward, his gaze leaving the grandeur of the starscape and coming to rest on the bow of the Star Destroyer stretching out more than a kilometer in front of him. He could remember the days when the mere sight of one of these ships would send shivers up the spines of the bravest of fighters and the most arrogant of smugglers.<br><br>But those days were gone, hopefully forever. The Empire had been rehabilitated, though of course many within the New Republic still refused to believe that. Under Supreme Commander Pellaeon&#x2019;s firm guidance, the Empire had signed a treaty with the New Republic, and was no longer any more threatening than the Bothans or the Corporate Sector or anyone else.<br><br>Almost unwillingly, he smiled as he gazed along the Star Destroyer&#x2019;s long prow. Of course, even in the old days of the Empire, this particular ship would probably have inspired more bewilderment than fear.<br><br>It was, after all, hard to take a bright red Star Destroyer very seriously.<br><br>From behind him, audible even over the rumble of the engines, came the sound of clumping boots. &#x201c;Okay, Karrde,&#x201d; Booster Terrik grunted as he came to a halt at his side. &#x201c;The comm&#x2019;s finally fixed.

An Imperial Star Destroyer was a huge amount of ship to take care of, and Booster never had nearly enough personnel to do the job right. &#x201c;H&#x2019;sishi?&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;<br><br>[Yes, Chieftain,] the Togorian called back from the comm board, her fur fluffing slightly as her clawed fingers touched the keys. [Transmission complete. Shall I begin alerting the rest of the network now?]<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Karrde said. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>H&#x2019;sishi nodded and returned her attention to the board.<br><br>With that, Karrde knew, he&#x2019;d done all he could for the moment. Turning again to face the stars, he folded his arms across his chest and tried hard to cultivate his patience. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; Booster murmured from beside him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be around this star in half an hour and be able to jump to lightspeed. We can be in the Domgrin system in two standard days, tops.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Assuming the hyperdrive doesn&#x2019;t break down again.&#x201d; Karrde waved a hand. &#x201c;Sorry. I&#x2019;m just&#x2014;you understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Booster said. &#x201c;But relax, all right? This is Luke and Mara we&#x2019;re talking about, not some fresh-hatched Neimoidian grubs. Whatever&#x2019;s going on, they&#x2019;re not going to be caught flat-footed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Karrde said. &#x201c;Though even Jedi can be surprised.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not the point, is it? The point is that I messed up. I don&#x2019;t like it when that happens.&#x201d;<br><br>Booster shrugged his massive shoulders. &#x201c;Like any of the rest of us do?&#x201d; he asked pointedly. &#x201c;You have to face the facts, Karrde, and Fact Number One is that you simply can&#x2019;t know everyone who works for you anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>Karrde glared out at the mockingly cheerful red ship stretched out in front of him. But Booster was right. This whole thing had gotten completely out of hand.<br><br>He&#x2019;d started out modestly enough, merely offering to provide timely information to the leaders of the New Republic and Empire so that both sides could be assured that the other wasn&#x2019;t plotting against them. And for the first couple of years everything had gone just fine.<br><br>The trouble had come when the various planetary and sector governments within the New Republic had woken up to the benefits of this handy service and decided they wanted aboard, too. After the near civil war that had broken out over the Caamas Document, Karrde hadn&#x2019;t really felt like turning them down, and with permission from his clients on Coruscant and Bastion he&#x2019;d gone ahead and expanded his operations.<br><br>Which naturally meant expanding his personnel as well. In retrospect, he supposed, it had only been a matter of time before something like this happened. He just wished it hadn&#x2019;t happened to Luke and Mara. &#x201c;Maybe not,&#x201d; he told Booster. &#x201c;But even if I can&#x2019;t handle everything personally, it&#x2019;s still my responsibility.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Booster said knowingly. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s your pride that&#x2019;s hurt, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Karrde eyed his old friend. &#x201c;Tell me, Booster. Has anyone ever told you you&#x2019;re truly irritating when you try to be sympathetic?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, the subject&#x2019;s come up once or twice,&#x201d; Booster said, grinning. He slapped Karrde&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Come on. Let&#x2019;s go down to the Transis Corridor and I&#x2019;ll buy you a drink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Assuming the drink dispensers are working today,&#x201d; Karrde murmured as they headed back along the command walkway.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yeah,&#x201d; Booster conceded. &#x201c;Always assuming that.&#x201d; ...<br><br>As cantinas went, Mara Jade Skywalker thought as she sipped her drink, this was definitely one of the strangest she&#x2019;d ever been in.<br><br>Part of that might simply have been due to the locale. Here in the Outer Rim, culture and style weren&#x2019;t exactly up to the standards of Coruscant and the rest of the Core Worlds. That might explain the gaudy wall hangings juxtaposed with ancient plumbing woven around modern drink dispensers, all of it set against a background decor consisting mainly of polished droid parts dating back to before the Clone Wars.<br><br>As for the unbreakable mugs and the heavy, stone-topped table she was seated at, the smoothed-over blaster scars in the walls and ceiling were more than enough explanation. When the patrons dived under the tables in the middle of a firefight, they would want those tables to afford them some protection. And they wouldn&#x2019;t want to find themselves sitting on bits of broken crockery, either.<br><br>There was no rationale at all, of course, for the very loud, very off-key music.<br><br>A brush of air touched her shoulder, and a heavyset man appeared from behind her, pushing his way through the milling crowd. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he huffed as he circled the table and landed his bulk back in the seat across from her. &#x201c;Business, business, business. Never lets up for a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose not,&#x201d; Mara agreed. He didn&#x2019;t fool her for a second; even without Force sensitivity she would have spotted the furtiveness hidden behind the noise and bustle. Jerf Huxley, master smuggler and minor terror of the Outer Rim, was up to something unpleasant.<br><br>The only question was how unpleasant he was planning for that something to be.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s crazy out here,&#x201d; Huxley went on, taking a noisy swallow of the drink he&#x2019;d left behind when he hurried off on the mysterious errand that had taken him away from their table. &#x201c; &#x2019;Course, you know all that. Or at least you used to.&#x201d; He eyed her over the rim of his mug. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, nothing,&#x201d; Mara said, not bothering to erase the smile that had caught the other&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;I was just thinking about what a trusting person you are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; he asked, frowning.<br><br>&#x201c;Your drink,&#x201d; Mara said, gesturing to his mug. &#x201c;You go away and leave it alone with me, and then you just come back and toss it down without even wondering if I&#x2019;ve put something in it.&#x201d;<br><br>Huxley&#x2019;s lips puckered, and through the Force Mara caught a hint of his chagrin. He hadn&#x2019;t worried about his drink, of course, because he&#x2019;d had her under close surveillance the whole time he was gone. He also hadn&#x2019;t intended for her to know that. &#x201c;All right, fine,&#x201d; he said, banging the mug back onto the table. &#x201c;Enough with the games. Let&#x2019;s hear it. Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>With a man like this, Mara knew, there was no point in glaze- coating it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here on behalf of Talon Karrde,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He wanted me to thank you for your assistance and that of your organization over the past ten years, and to inform you that your services will no longer be required.&#x201d;<br><br>Huxley&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t even twitch. Clearly, he&#x2019;d already suspected this was coming. &#x201c;Starting when?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Starting now,&#x201d; Mara said. &#x201c;Thanks for the drink, and I&#x2019;ll be on my way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not so fast,&#x201d; Huxley said, lifting a hand.<br><br>Mara froze halfway to her feet. Behind Huxley, blasters had abruptly appeared in the hands of three of the men who had hitherto been minding their own business at the bar. Blasters that were, not surprisingly, pointed at her. &#x201c;Sit down,&#x201d; he ordered. Carefully, Mara eased back into her chair. &#x201c;Was there something else?&#x201d; she asked mildly.<br><br>Huxley gestured again, more emphatically this time, and the off-key background music shut off. As did all conversation. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s it, is it?&#x201d; Huxley demanded quietly. In the sudden silence, even a soft voice seemed to ring against the battered walls. &#x201c;Karrde&#x2019;s going to toss us aside, just like that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I presume you read the news,&#x201d; Mara said, keeping her voice calm. All around her, she could sense the single-minded animosity of the crowd. Huxley had apparently stocked the place with his friends and associates. &#x201c;Karrde&#x2019;s getting out of the smuggling business. Has been, for the past three years. He doesn&#x2019;t need your services anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, he doesn&#x2019;t need,&#x201d; Huxley said with a sniff. &#x201c;What about what we need?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Mara said. &#x201c;What do you need?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you don&#x2019;t remember what it&#x2019;s like in the Outer Rim, Jade,&#x201d; Huxley said, leaning over the table toward her. &#x201c;But out here, you don&#x2019;t split things three ways against the ends. You work for one group, period, or you don&#x2019;t work at all. We burned our skyarches behind us years ago when we started working for Karrde. If he pulls out, what are we supposed to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I expect you&#x2019;ll have to make new arrangements,&#x201d; Mara said. &#x201c;Look, you had to have known this was coming. Karrde&#x2019;s made no secret of the direction he&#x2019;s been taking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; Huxley said contemptuously. &#x201c;Like anyone believed he&#x2019;d really go straight.&#x201d;<br><br>He drew himself up. &#x201c;So you want to know what we need? Fine. What we need is something to tide us over until we can get back in the business with someone else.&#x201d;<br><br>So there it was: a simple and straightforward pocket-shake. Nothing subtle from this bunch. &#x201c;How much?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Five hundred thousand.&#x201d; His lip twisted slightly. &#x201c;In cash credits.&#x201d;<br><br>Mara kept her face expressionless. She&#x2019;d come here prepared for something like this, but that number was way beyond reason. &#x201c;And where exactly do you expect me to get this little tide-me-over?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t carry that much spending money on me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get cute,&#x201d; Huxley growled. &#x201c;You know as well as I do that Karrde&#x2019;s got a sector clearinghouse over on Gonmore. They&#x2019;ll have all the credits there we need.&#x201d;<br><br>He dug into a pocket and produced a hold-out blaster. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to call and tell them to bring it to us,&#x201d; he said, leveling the weapon at her face across the table. &#x201c;Half a million. Now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d; Casually, keeping her hands visible, Mara turned her head to look behind her. Most of the cantina&#x2019;s nonsmuggler patrons had already made a quiet exit, she noted, or else had gathered into groups on either side of the confrontation, staying well out of the potential lines of fire. Of more immediate concern was the group of about twenty humans and aliens who had spread themselves out in a semicircle directly behind her, all of them with weapons trained on her back.<br><br>All of them also showing varying degrees of wariness, she noted with a certain malicious amusement. Her reputation had apparently preceded her. &#x201c;You throw an interesting party, Huxley,&#x201d; she said, turning back to face the smuggler chief. &#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t really think you&#x2019;re equipped to deal with a Jedi, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Huxley smiled. A very evil smile. A surprisingly evil smile, actually, given the circumstances. &#x201c;Matter of fact, yeah, I do.&#x201d; He raised his voice. &#x201c;Bats?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Mind of a Missionary: What Global Kingdom Workers Tell Us About Thriving on Mission Today</h2><p>Have you ever wondered what makes a missionary tick?

Anyone who reads this book will surely be encouraged and better equipped to fulfill the Heavenly call on their life!" -- <b>Pastor How &amp; Pastor Lia, Senior Pastors of Heart of God Church Singapore, hogc.sg</b><b></b><br>"In the contemporary Church, there's little difference between having a fleeting 'burden for missions' and starry-eyed wanderlust. The call for long-term missionaries willing to lay aside their lives for the cause of Christ found in past generations are mysteriously absent today. The missions enterprise is taking on the flavor of a microwave culture aimed at scratching our consumeristic itch. David Joannes exposes the need for more missionary grit; he plunges the depths of past missionary mindsets to pull out gems for this generation to learn from. Anything written by David Joannes is a worthy read.

His life was so pure that it was said that he seemed not to have inherited Original Sin. According to legend, he received the name of Bonaventure (<i>bona ventura, </i>good fortune) at a very young age from St. Francis of Assisi and was cured of an illness through the saint's intercession. In 1243 he became a Franciscan (considered the Order's second founder) and later earned the position of Master of Theology with St. Thomas Aquinas at Paris in 1257. He was made a Cardinal by Pope Gregory X and later presided at the Council of Lyons in 1274, where he died suddenly. He was canonized by Pope Sixtus IV in 1484 and is known as the Seraphic Doctor of the Church.<br><br> St. Bonaventure also wrote the <i>Commentary on the Gospel of St. Luke</i>, <i>Breviloquium</i>, <i>De Septem Itineribus Aeternitatis</i>, <i>Itinerarium Mentis ad Deum</i>, <i>De Reductione Artium ad Theologiam</i>, and <i>Soliloquium</i>.

Grandpa shows the kids the newspaper headline: astronauts have landed on Mars. A television reporter comes on saying that the astronauts discovered a &#x201c;thick, glutinous substance&#x201d; on the ground and falling from the sky. He suggests that it could be pie filling. The kids fantasize about going to Mars and having Martian pie. Grandpa falls asleep in front of the television and begins to dream. He is on Mars, where there are pies everywhere and raining from the sky. The pie in the sky situation, though, is a little out of hand, and the Martians had been waiting for someone to help. They decide that the best solution is to catch the treats as they fall and start a business, selling the pies all over Earth. Grandpa awakes, and both the news reporter and the newspaper confirm that there were, in fact, no pies on Mars, but it's still fun to dream. Although this third book in the series has a new illustrator,&nbsp; the feel from the previous books is not lost. The pen-and-ink illustrations are filled with action; color is only used while Grandpa is dreaming, which adds to the fantasy of it all.

In <em>Rangers, Trappers, and Trailblazers</em>, <strong>John Fraley</strong> recounts the true adventures of people who earned their living among the mountains and along the cold, clear rivers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Here are the stories of the intrepid Glacier Park Ranger Clyde Fauley and his young family using a cable bucket to reach their isolated cabin across the Middle Fork, trapper Slim Link's fateful meeting with a grizzly bear in the deep woods of the North Fork, and the life and times of Henry Thol, the ranger's ranger, who happily snowshoed hundreds of miles through deep snows and minus-40 cold to patrol the South Fork wilderness. Tragedies and near-misses abound: a fatal shootout, tangles with bears and packrats, a devastating train wreck, and a missing airplane. But these are balanced with tales of courage, endurance, and remarkable personal achievement. Fraley tells all in intriguing detail wrested from primary sources.</p><p><p>"<strong>John Fraley</strong> came to Montana as a teenager to attend the University of Montana, where he received a B.S. in Wildlife Biology. He continued his education at Montana State University and received an M.S. in Fish and Wildlife Management. John worked for the state wildlife agency for nearly forty years, mostly in the forks of the Flathead; he retired in 2017. For thirty-two years he has served as an adjunct instructor at Flathead Valley Community College where he teaches wildlife conservation and other courses. John has written two previous books on Flathead pioneers within Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness:<em> A Woman s Way West</em>, in 1998, and<em> Wild River Pioneers</em>, in 2008. Over the years, he has written numerous magazine articles on the history of the Flathead. John s wife, Dana, and children, Kevin, Heather, and Troy, continue to share with him a love of wandering around the backcountry of the three forks of the Flathead."</p><p>"<strong>John Fraley</strong> has obviously done his homework in presenting these deeply human (and true) stories.&nbsp; In the process of connecting past people to the Forks of the Flathead River, John encourages us to form our own enduring relationship with this wild landscape.&nbsp; A master storyteller, indeed!"</p> --<p><strong>Chas Cartwright</strong>, <em>Former Superintendent</em> - Glacier National Park</p><br><br><p>"...there is something for everyone to be found in...the new collection of historic accounts from longtime Montana Fish &amp; Wildlife Biologist <strong>John Fraley</strong>.&nbsp; His painstaking and extensive research has made it possible to share tales that were previously undiscovered, as well as to shine new light on and correct common misconceptions about some of northwest Montana's more well-known campfire stories.&nbsp; Fraley manages to transport the reader along to a place where a once hardscrabble life has certainly changed, and at the same time revel in what has incredibly and wonderfully remained the same.&nbsp; In the spirit of the many trailblazing men and women featured in this collection (as well as the very spirit of the author himself),<em> Rangers, Trappers, and Trailblazers</em> makes the reader yearn to have similar adventures themselves."</p> --<p><strong>Jacob Thomas</strong>, <em>Executive Director</em> - Northwest Montana Historical Society</p><br><br><p>"In <em>Rangers, Trappers, and Trailblazers</em>, <strong>John Fraley</strong> brings to life the people who lent their names to the iconic geography of the North Fork and Bob Marshall Wilderness, including Bob himself.&nbsp; He reveals tales of Forest Service rangers past to present who patrolled on snowshoe and by air, unravels mysteries of trappers who disappeared into the vast wilderness, and tracks down missing facts about plane crashes, rescues, and the hearty folk who homesteaded in places so remote that they are only reached by horse or foot even today.&nbsp; Wilderness lovers, history buffs, adventurers, residents, and visitors to northwest Montana will all love this book."</p> --<p><strong>Carol Treadwell, Ph.D</strong>, <em>Executive Director</em> - Bob Marshall Wilderness Foundation</p></p><h2>Heal Yourself with Sunlight</h2><p>In Heal Yourself with Sunlight, Andreas Moritz has provided scientific evidence that sunlight is essential for good health, and that a lack of sun exposure can be held responsible for many of today&#x2019;s ailments. Sunlight is a nutrient, a medicine, a remedy, all at once. It is not some bottled compound you can find at a drug store alone. It is naturally available to everyone. The dosage is under your control and your body easily tells you when you have had just about the right amount of it. Unfortunately, even though sunlight is readily available all through the day, many people fail to profit from it. Read this book to learn how you can harness sunlight, nature&#x2019;s most potent and curative powers, for maintaining good health. It is a misconception that the sun is the main culprit for causing skin cancer, certain cataracts leading to blindness, and aging. Research has actually shown that most skin cancers occur among those who rarely ever spend time in the sun or who use sunscreens filled with carcinogenic chemicals. It has been known for several decades that those living mostly in the outdoors, at high altitudes, or near the equator, have the lowest incidence of skin cancers and are among the healthiest people on the planet. Patients suffering from gout, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, tuberculosis, anemia, cystitis, eczema, acne, psoriasis, herpes, lupus, sciatica, kidney problems, asthma, as well as burns, have all shown to receive great benefit from the healing rays of the sun. Heal Yourself With Sunlight tells you, among other things, how Vitamin D, which the skin produces in response to sun exposure, keeps the body&#x2019;s immune system strong, prevents the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, and reverses numerous types of cancer, among many other illnesses. Sunlight is the ultimate source of life on earth and the ideal panacea to increase the effectiveness of every other healing modality. Unlike drugs, surgery or radiation, sunlight costs nothing, has no harmful side-effects, and foremost of all, it makes you feel good.</p><p>Mortiz is a health consultant and practitioner of Ayurvedic Medicine.</p><h2>Miss Fannie&#39;s Hat</h2><p>Ninety-nine year old Miss Fannie has lots of hats, and she loves them all. But her favorite is the pink straw hat with the silk roses. That's the one Miss Fannie has worn on Easter Sunday for the past thirty-five years.

This heartwarming story about the rewards of unselfish love will enchant readers young and old.<p>The star of Miss Fannie's Hat is based on <b>Jan Karon</b>'s own grandmother. "My grandmother, Miss Fannie, was so wonderful I wanted to share her with everyone," says Jan Karon. "I wrote Miss Fannie's Hat to give both children and adults a sense of family, to give them the grandmother or great-grandmother they never had, or always wished they had.

At age 99, Miss Fannie has much history--and even more hats. She was wearing her green velour hat when she witnessed a terrible flood in 1916. Her wide-brimmed felt hat with the gleaming black feather reminds her of the hawk she caught to keep it from killing her hens and biddies. But her pink straw hat with silk roses truly is her favorite. For 35 years she's worn this hat to church every Easter Sunday, and "it always makes her feel brand-new, like Easter itself." She's not the only one who thinks it's special. When her handsome young preacher asks her to donate a hat to the church auction, Miss Fannie knows what she has to do. She takes a deep breath, thinks of her favorite verse from the Bible, "With God, all things are possible," and wraps up her pink straw hat. But she doesn't realize just how much <i>is</i> possible until the Easter Sunday after the auction.<p> Jan Kuron, popular author of the bestselling series for adults, <i>The Mitford Years</i>, as well as the children's book, <i>Jeremy: The Tale of an Honest Bunny</i>, crafts a pleasing story of a charming woman (based on Kuron's own grandmother) who reaps the sweet rewards of her generosity.

He divides his time among Florida, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.<p>1</p><p></p><p>Later that morning . . .</p><p></p><p>Monday, November 5, 10:30 a.m.</p><p></p><p>By 10:30 in the morning all eight autopsy tables at New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, known colloquially as the OCME, were in use, as the team tried to catch up with demand. Over the weekend there had been a backup of ten bodies that had not been considered forensic emergencies and had been left for Monday morning. Besides those ten, six new cases had come in between late Sunday afternoon and early that morning. Table #1, the table farthest from the stainless-steel sinks, had seen the most action. This was the table favored by Dr. Jack Stapleton. Since he was almost always the first doctor in the "pit" in the morning, he got to choose his station, and he always told Vinnie Ammendola, the mortuary tech with whom he usually teamed, to nab it. Situated at the periphery, it was a little bit separate from the main commotion in the autopsy room when all the tables were in use. At that time Jack was already starting his third case. Most of the other tables were still on their first.</p><p></p><p>"So!" Jack said, straightening up. He had just carefully shaved away the blood-soaked, matted hair from the right side of the victim's head. He had been very careful not to distort the wound he wished to expose. What was now obvious was a completely circular dark-red-to-black lesion an inch or two above the woman's right ear, surrounded by a narrow circular abrasion. The patient was on her back, with her head rotated to the left and propped up on a wooden block. She was naked and so pale she could have been mistaken for a wax-museum model.</p><p></p><p>"Is the entrance wound round or oval?" Jack liked a didactic style and frequently used it even when other people weren't listening, as often happened when he was working with Vinnie. Vinnie had a habit of zoning out on occasion. But this morning Jack had an attentive audience. Lieutenant Detective Lou Soldano, an old friend of Jack and Jack's wife, Laurie, had shown up. Over the years Lou had come to truly appreciate the enormous benefits forensic pathology could provide to law enforcement, particularly when it came to homicide investigation, which was his specialty. Whenever there was a case that Lou thought could be helped by forensics, he made it a point to observe the autopsy. Although there hadn't been any such cases for a number of months, that morning there had been three.</p><p></p><p>"I'd say circular," Lou said. Lou was standing across from Jack on the patient's left side. Also on that side was Vinnie. Next to Jack was a second mortuary tech, Carlos Sanchez, who had been newly hired by the OCME and was now at the very beginning of his orientation and training. As one of the more experienced techs, Vinnie generally broke in newbies by having them work closely with him. Jack was accustomed to the routine and usually didn't mind, provided it didn't slow him down too much. Jack was one of those people who didn't like to waste time and had little patience for incompetence. So far, he wasn't all that impressed with Carlos. It wasn't anything specific, more an attitude thing, as if the man wasn't all that interested.</p><p></p><p>"I agree," Jack said. "Vinnie?"</p><p></p><p>"Circular," Vinnie said, rolling his eyes. Vinnie and Jack had worked with each other so many times over so many years that they could anticipate each other. Vinnie knew that the tone of voice Jack had used strongly suggested he was about to start a "teaching" session, which invariably meant the autopsy would end up taking considerably longer than otherwise, keeping Vinnie away from the coffee break he always took after the third case was over. Vinnie was a coffee addict and his last cup had been just after seven that morning.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Sanchez?" Jack asked, ignoring Vinnie's mild acting out.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Carlos blurted.</p><p></p><p>Jack turned to look into the eyes of the new hire, just visible through the man's plastic face shield. "Are we keeping you from some other, more interesting engagement, Mr. Sanchez?" he asked sarcastically, but then let it go. He turned back to Lou. "It is definitely circular, meaning the bullet entered perpendicular to the plane of the skull. More apropos, it is certainly not what is described as stellate or jagged. Now, do you see any stippling around the periphery of the wound?" The little red dots in the skin that sometimes surrounded gunshot wounds resulted from gunpowder residue emerging from a gun barrel along with the bullet.</p><p></p><p>"I don't see that much except on the ear," Lou said, trying to be optimistic.</p><p></p><p>"There is a bit on the ear and also some on the neck," Jack said, pointing. "Obviously the full head of hair absorbed most of it."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think I'm going to like where you're going with all this," Lou said. The victim was the wife of one of Lou's detective colleagues who also worked out of the NYPD's Homicide Division.</p><p></p><p>Jack nodded. There was no doubt that Lou had become quite forensically knowledgeable over the years of their friendship. "There's more. Let's use a wooden dowel to align this entrance wound above the right ear with the exit wound below the left mandible."</p><p></p><p>Vinnie handed Jack the wooden rod he had leaned against the autopsy table. Grasping it at both ends, Jack held it so that it rested on the crown of the patient's head but lined up with the two wounds.</p><p></p><p>Lou reluctantly agreed. "I'm getting the picture: The pathway of the bullet is definitely downward."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news," Jack offered, hearing the disappointment in his friend's voice. "Unfortunately, what we see here is not a contact wound. My guess at this point would be that the gun barrel had to have been about two feet away and maybe as much as thirty inches. And the trajectory was definitely oriented caudally. Are you aware of the statistics about this?"</p><p></p><p>"Not exactly," Lou said. "But I know it's not what I was hoping. Jesus, I've known this guy for more than twenty years. I've even had dinner in their home out in Queens a dozen times, especially after I got divorced. They had their problems, like all couples. But hell! They have two grown kids."</p><p></p><p>"Ninety percent or more of small-arms suicides are contact wounds, meaning the barrel of the gun is up against the skull when discharged. In only about five percent of suicides is the bullet path downward, and an even smaller percentage where it's directed from the back to the front, both of which we see here."</p><p></p><p>"So you don't think this was a suicide?" Lou asked, almost plaintively.</p><p></p><p>Jack shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Can we get on with this freakin' autopsy," Vinnie complained.</p><p></p><p>Jack flashed a dirty look at his favorite mortuary tech. Vinnie ignored it. "I'm having caffeine withdrawal."</p><p></p><p>"Was there a suicide note?" Jack asked, returning his attention to Lou.</p><p></p><p>"Clutched in her left hand," Lou said with a nod. "One of Walter's service automatics was in her right hand. She was lying on their bed on her back. It was a mess."</p><p></p><p>"And he had called you?" Jack said.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah," Lou said. "We'd been together most of the evening after being called out on that first autopsy we did. Walter found her dead when he got home, or so he said. I was the one who put in the nine-one-one call as I was leaving my apartment on my way over to see him. I got there before anyone else, and the man was beside himself. It was godawful. Not that I haven't seen worse."</p><p></p><p>"Well, we'll have to see how it plays out," Jack said. "Maybe there was a third party involved. But I certainly will not be signing this out as a suicide. I'm definitely thinking homicide. But let's do the autopsy and go from there."</p><p></p><p>"Hallelujah," Vinnie said, making a rapid sign of the cross in the air in appreciation.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not be blasphemous," Jack chided sardonically.</p><p></p><p>"You should talk," Vinnie scoffed. More than anyone at the OCME, Vinnie knew just how irreverent Jack Stapleton could be. Jack was not a religious man after his first wife and two young daughters had been killed in a commuter plane crash. He couldn't imagine a Christian God would let such a terrible thing happen.</p><p></p><p>The postmortem went quickly. Other than a number of uterine fibroids, the woman's general health had been excellent and there was no pathology. The part of the autopsy that took the longest came after Vinnie had shown Carlos how to remove the skull cap. With appropriate exposure, Jack had carefully followed the bullet's transit through the brain, where it had wreaked complete havoc. While Jack was busy, Vinnie exposed the underside of the skull cap to photograph the beveled edges of the inner aspect of the entrance wound.</p><p></p><p>When Jack's third autopsy was complete, he left Vinnie and Carlos to clean up and return the cadaver to the walk-in cooler. Although Lou usually departed as soon as the main part of the autopsy was over, on this occasion he stayed until the bitter end. Jack sensed he was reluctant to head back to his lonely apartment in SoHo. The implication was that he needed to talk more about the disturbing autopsy results, even though he was plainly exhausted from having been up all night.</p><p></p><p>After changing out of their autopsy gear, Jack took Lou up to the so-called lunchroom on the second floor, which wasn't much with its blue-painted concrete-block walls, cheap molded-plastic furniture, and handful of vending machines. For a modern medical examiner's office with a staff of highly trained, world-class forensic pathologists, it was pathetic. But there was a light at the end of the tunnel. A brand-new high-rise NYC medical examiner's building had been constructed on 26th Street, four blocks south of the sad, existing six-story structure that had been built almost a century ago at 30th Street and First Avenue. Most of the Manhattan office's hundreds of employees had already moved to the palatial new location. Those who had yet to go were the toxicologists and the entire bevy of MEs. The problem was that the new building did not have an autopsy room. A new state-of-the-art autopsy facility was still in the planning stages, to be built as a separate structure next to the new high-rise. Until it was operational, Jack and his colleagues had to remain in the old, outdated structure.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing the choices, what can I get you?" Jack asked. He regarded his friend of almost twenty years. As his name clearly suggested, Lou was distinctly southern Italian, with thick, reasonably long, mostly dark hair and equally dark eyes and decidedly olive skin. A handsome, heavy-featured man of medium height and musculature, with a girth that suggested too much pasta and not enough exercise. As usual, he was wearing a dark blue suit that didn't appear to have been pressed in the previous year. His rumpled white dress shirt was open at the collar and his gravy-stained silk tie was loosened and appeared never to have been untied, but rather slipped over the head at the end of each and every day.</p><p></p><p>The comparison with Jack was stark, especially when the two were standing right next to each other as they were now. Jack's hair was a light brown, cut moderately short, with a blush of gray over his temples. His eyes were the color of maple syrup and his complexion suggested he had a slight tan even when he hadn't been in the sun for months. At six feet two inches tall, with an athletic build from bike riding and street basketball, he seemed to tower over Lou, whose habit was to hunch over as if his head were far too heavy.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Lou admitted. He was having trouble making up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"How about a water," Jack suggested. He knew the last thing Lou needed was more coffee. What he really needed was sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, water's fine," Lou said.</p><p></p><p>Jack got two waters and sat down across from Lou.</p><p></p><p>"You'll let me know what toxicology shows on the second case," Lou said.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely," Jack said. "As soon as I know." All three cases that Lou had come in to watch that morning involved the NYC Police Department. The one Lou was currently referring to was a "death in custody" case. During the autopsy Jack had been able to show Lou that the prisoner's hyoid bone had been fractured, which was a clear demonstration that a lethal choke hold had been used. It had happened during an arrest. The question now was whether the force was justified or whether it was excessive. The neighborhood where it had happened was up in arms and wanted answers.</p><p></p><p>Lou was also awaiting final word on the first case he had watched Jack handle that morning. It, too, was an arrest that had gone bad, resulting in a shootout with the victim holed up in his car, where he was hit four times. Several bystanders claimed that the victim had yelled "enough" and had stopped firing, yet still the police shot him. Once again it was a potential PR nightmare for the police department, and a tragedy if it proved to be true. To get answers, Jack had painstakingly tracked all four bullets in the man's body and now wanted to re-create the scene in the special laboratory in the new high-rise building to figure out exactly what had happened and when.</p><p></p><p>"It's been an interesting morning," Jack said. "I'm especially sorry that I couldn't be more help for your buddy. Probably the case is going to turn on the suicide note and whether it's authentic. Divorce isn't fun, but it is a lot better than homicide, if that's what the case turns out to be."</p><p></p><p>"Enough about me and my problems," Lou said with a wave of dismissal. "What's up at the Stapleton-Montgomery household these days? I haven't talked to you or Laur for ages." Lou had met Laurie Montgomery, Jack's wife, before Jack had been hired by the NYC OCME. Lou and Laurie had even briefly dated until they both sensed it wasn't to be and became fast friends instead. When Jack came on the scene, Lou had been his advocate. Laur had been the name one of Lou's daughters had used when she'd first met Laurie, and, thinking it cute, Lou had adopted it as well.</p><p></p><p>"Please," Jack said. "Let's not go there."</p><p></p><p>"Uh-oh." Lou leaned forward over the table. "Knowing you as I do, I don't like the sound of this. What's up?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if I want to get into it," Jack told him.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't talk to me, who are you going to talk to?" Lou arched a brow. "I love both you guys."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Bible in 366 Days for Men of Faith by Angus Buchan (2012-08-01)</h2><p><i>The Bible in 366 Days for Men of Faith </i>Devotional, explores meaningful, key Scripture passages from the New Living Translation (NLT), presented chronologically from Genesis to Revelation, providing the essence of the Bible in 366 days.

Sophia receives her first hat from Mrs. Goldman when she is a tiny baby, and she grows up to spend time helping Mrs. Goldman add the finishing touches to her knitted hats by making pom-poms. During a cold prewinter walk, Sophia notices that Mrs. Goldman's head is bare because she spends all of her time knitting for others. Sophia makes it her mitzvah (good deed, as Mrs. Goldman taught her) to use her limited knitting skills to make Mrs. Goldman a hat. Sophia works hard but finds that her finished product has a few holes in it. Feeling discouraged for a moment, the child remembers Mrs. Goldman's praise of her pom-poms, and she adds red pom-poms to any areas that are bare; Mrs. Goldman is delighted. Mixed-media illustrations showcase the research the illustrator put into learning how to knit to faithfully execute the artwork. Soft lines and muted color choices give the illustrations a look that perfectly complements the art form. Back matter includes a pattern for making a knitted hat and instructions for making pom-poms. The hat pattern does require adult assistance and a basic working knowledge of knitting, though the pom-poms could easily be accomplished by a novice.

And as public a figure as he has been, he is in many ways the least known.

With Derek Jeter nearing the end of his iconic career, not to mention a milestone (3,000 hits) no New York Yankee has reached, I thought it was the right time to do a head-to-toe examination of Jeter&#x2019;s mass appeal. He is the DiMaggio of his time, a beloved but distant figure. My goal was to humanize Jeter. I wanted to paint a public portrait of a private man while celebrating his dignified approach and explaining why his number 2 is number 1 in the closets of kids everywhere. </p> <br><strong>Q:</strong>How did you gather all the material in <i>The Captain</i>? <br> <p><strong>A:</strong> I&#x2019;ve covered Jeter&#x2019;s entire career as a newspaper and Internet columnist in the New York market, so I had a strong base of firsthand observations and knowledge and one-on-one and group interviews with Jeter to work with. I also conducted more than 200 interviews exclusively for this book, including conversations with Jeter and past and present teammates, coaches, friends, opponents, teachers, scouts, executives, admirers, and detractors. (I define his detractors as admirers willing to discuss the shortstop&#x2019;s human flaws.) </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your favorite anecdote in the book from Jeter&#x2019;s early years as a Yankee?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> One of my favorites involves the period before Derek was drafted. As a child he started telling his parents and others he would someday play shortstop for the New York Yankees, and as a teenager he predicted to some that he would marry Mariah Carey (well, he almost went 2 for 2). But the surreal twists and turns of the draft of &#x2019;92, when Jeter dropped into the Yankees&#x2019; lap as the sixth overall pick, lends credence to the notion he was meant to be a Yank. Houston rejected the advice of its lead Jeter scout, a former Hall of Fame pitcher for Detroit named Hal Newhouser, who resigned because the Astros didn&#x2019;t pick Derek at number 1 (they took college star Phil Nevin instead). Cincinnati scouting director Julian Mock rejected the advice of his own people and decided in the middle of a draft-day jog to select a college outfielder from central Florida (Chad Mottola) instead of the high school shortstop from Kalamazoo (Jeter) at number 5. To this day, Derek swears he was so convinced he was going in the top five of the draft, he didn&#x2019;t even know that his dream team, the Yankees, were picking sixth. He knows now... I also enjoyed discovering how Cal Ripken Jr.&#x2019;s decision to shake a young boy&#x2019;s hand in 1993 ultimately put twelve-year-old Jeffrey Maier in the Yankee Stadium stands in 1996, when Maier deflected Derek Jeter&#x2019;s home-run ball into American League Championship Series lore and helped end Baltimore&#x2019;s season and Ripken&#x2019;s indelible reign at short. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jeter is often portrayed as the perfect athlete. Is he perfect?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Jeter is about as close to perfect as a superstar athlete can get, but no, he is not an infallible player or person. As a product of parents who raised him on the strict terms of behavioral contracts he was compelled to sign, Jeter never put himself or his team in an embarrassing position. But he&#x2019;s been overly sensitive to criticism, he&#x2019;s terrible at forgiving and forgetting those he believes have slighted him, and at times he could have been a better captain to Alex Rodriguez, who craved Jeter&#x2019;s approval in his early seasons as a Yankee. Jeter didn&#x2019;t give it.</p> <p></p><p>Every spring, Little Leaguers across the country mimic his stance&#x2014;waggling the bat handle above the right ear&#x2014;and squabble over the right to wear his number, 2, the next number to be retired by the world&#x2019;s most famous ball team.

In rural Ohio, she managed a household of 11 kids alongside a less-than-supportive husband. One day, at age 67, she decided to go for a nice long walk . . . and ended up completing the Appalachian Trail.<br> &nbsp;<br> With just the clothes on her back and a pair of thin canvas sneakers on her feet, Grandma Gatewood hiked up ridges and down ravines. She braved angry storms and witnessed breathtaking sunrises. When things got particularly tough, she relied on the kindness of strangers or sheer luck to get her through the night. When the newspapers got wind of her amazing adventure, the whole country cheered her on to the end of her trek, which came just a few months after she set out. A story of true grit and girl power at any age, <i>Grandma Gatewood</i> proves that no peak is insurmountable.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Jennifer Thermes</b> is the children&#x2019;s book author and illustrator of <i>Charles Darwin&#x2019;s Around-the-World Adventure</i> and an accomplished map illustrator.

Beginning in Georgia, in the year 1955, she hiked all 2,160 miles with very little supplies and just a pair of canvas shoes on her feet. Chronicling Gatewood's journey, Thermes recounts the information in story form, making this a great example of narrative nonfiction. Fact boxes reveal tidbits of information about the trail, while maps show the pathway of her incredible trek. Thermes's artwork, done in watercolor and colored pencil, has a warm homey feel to it. Back matter includes a more detailed biography of Gatewood and some information about the trail. VERDICT Beautiful illustrations and an emphasis on the value of nature, determination, and grit make this a great nonfiction selection for any library.&#x2014;Jasmine L.

With his wife, the artist Anni Albers, Albers toured pre-Columbian archeological sites and monuments during his 12 or more trips to Mexico and other Latin American countries between 1935 and 1968. On each visit, Albers took black-and-white photographs of pyramids, shrines, sanctuaries and landscapes, which he later assembled into rarely seen photo collages. The resulting works demonstrate Albers&#x2019; continued formal experimentation with geometry, this time accentuating a pre-Columbian aesthetic.</p><p><i>Josef Albers in Mexico</i> brings together photographs, photo collages, prints and significant paintings from the <i>Variants/Adobe</i> (1946&#x2013;66) and <i>Homage to the Square</i> (1950&#x2013;76) series from the collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Anni and Josef Albers Foundation.

Theres a villain out to hang Mordechai and murder his countrymen; a king who enjoys drinking; and a beautiful and noble queen. There are assassins, palace intrigue and a climactic battle scene -- and a happy ending, to boot. What more could you ask for in a good child s story?<br><br> The holiday associated with the book can seem child-like, too. Purim is celebrated with costumes, carnivals, and abundant merriment. Kids dress up as Esther, Mordechai, Haman and Achashveirosh, wearing plastic hats and cellophane scepters. Purim is the great holiday of make-believe.<br><br> All this make believe, though, can have unintended consequences. Chief among them is the fact that many of us are likely to remain with childlike views of Purim and the Megillah long after we ve turned adults. Our perspective upon Mordechai and Esther and their struggle can easily remain as one-dimensional as the face paint we use to impersonate these people in costume.<br><br> In this book, Rabbi Fohrman invites the reader to look at the Book of Esther with fresh eyes; to join him, as it were, on a guided adventure -- a close reading of the ancient biblical text. In so doing, he reveals another Purim story; a richer, deeper narrative more suited perhaps, to the eyes of an adult than to a child. As layers of meaning are gradually revealed, Esther's hidden story comes alive in a vibrant, unexpected way -- offering the reader a fascinating and stirring encounter with the queen whose costume they wore as children -- the queen they thought they knew.</p><p>Rabbi David Fohrman lectures internationally on Biblical themes. He heads the Curriculum Initiative of the Areivim Philanthropic Group, and directs the Hoffberger Institute for Text Study. He currently resides in Woodmere, NY with his wife and children, where he also serves as resident scholar at the Young Israel of Woodmere. Rabbi Fohrman&#39;s first book, The Beast that Crouches at the Door, was a finalist for the 2007 National Jewish Book Award. In earlier years, Rabbi Fohrman served as a senior editor and writer for ArtScroll&#39;s Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud, and taught Biblical themes at the Johns Hopkins University. His recorded lectures are available at rabbifohrman.com.In his lectures and in his writings, Rabbi David Fohrman accomplishes something very unique. He combines elements of surprise and ingenuity with the authentic ring of truth. He did this with his first book, The Beast that Crouches at the Door and he has done it once more here, with the The Queen You Thought You Knew . Rabbi Fohrman s latest offering provides a stirring and creative new look at the story of Queen Esther. It is sure to enrich, enliven and refresh the reader's experience of Purim. --Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Executive Vice President, Orthodox Union<br><br>IN looking at a Biblical text, David Fohrman asks questions that no one else ever asked, and because of that he gives fresh and arresting answers.<br><br>Fohrman has already distinguished himself with his first book, The Beast That Crouches at the Door, an original look at the narratives of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel. Now he turns his attention to the Scroll of Esther, the Megillah, just in time for Purim oh, and one of the first questions he asks is, why call it Purim?<br><br>Purim stems from the Hebrew word pur, which means lot, and refers to the lots cast by Haman to determine the date he would kill all the Jews of Persia. Why remember a book of biblical salvation by the genocidal terminology of the Hitler of the day?<br><br>Fohrman writes:<br><br> Imagine it was 1948 and Israel had just proclaimed its statehood and managed to ward off several invading Arab armies. The question comes up: People will want to celebrate this moment year after year; what should we name the day? Someone in the back of the room raises his hand and says:<br><br> Let s call it: Tokarev Day. <br><br> Why Tokarev Day, everyone asks.<br><br> Well, he continues, when the Arabs tried to kill us all, their weapon of choice was Russian made self-loading Tokarev rifles. Thank G-d we were saved. So let s call it Tokarev Day! <br><br> And then everyone applauds and decides that this is a wonderful name for the new holiday.<br><br> That s roughly what seems to have taken place concerning Purim. Why name the day after the instrument of choice used by our enemy? It s not his holiday, it s ours! <br><br>IN The Queen You Thought You Knew (HFBS and OU Press), Fohrman is skilled at linking the micro to the macro. He takes a very close look at the biblical text, picking up on unnoticed sequences, scrutinizing hitherto unseen grammatical and syntactical oddities.<br><br>But he does not produce a book of picky points and scholarly obscurities. He builds on small, careful questions to produce a book of large panoramas. From small puzzles he extracts links to large stretches of biblical history. The Queen You Thought You Knew is a book of uncommon range and insight.<br><br>It is also a very fun book. Fohrman s style is direct and engaging (per Tokarev Day). Indeed, his style conveys the feeling of inevitability. The reader finds himself saying, I just knew he was going to say that. I knew where he was going with this. To read Fohrman is akin to listening to a powerful symphony with that driving sense of inevitability.<br><br>Of course, Fohrman s reader doesn t really have a clue where Fohrman is going, he just thinks he does. That s part of author Fohrman s genius; he convinces you, the reader, that the two of you are co-authors. Fohrman s subtext is a conspirational link between author and reader. For that reason the book is hard to put down how can you put down your own book?<br><br>Who said Bible study couldn t be fun?<br><br>HERE'S just a small sampling of 3 questions (besides the curious name of the holiday) that Fohrman raises:<br><br>1. After Haman is hung and his sons are killed after the enemy is defeated and dispatched why does the Megillah drag on another three chapters? Aren t they anti-climactic?<br><br>2. After Haman decreed his genocidal plan, Esther seems to hesitate before approaching her husband, Ahasuerus, to change his mind. Esther s Uncle Mordechai tells niece Esther that if she will not seek relief from the King, salvation will come from another source. <br><br>Well, if the Jews can be rescued from some other source, why does Mordechai urge Esther to see the King? If she s not really needed because salvation is available elsewhere why the pressure on Esther?<br><br>(to read the rest of the review, visit the Intermountain Jewish News website and search for "The Queen You Thought You Knew") --Rabbi Hillel Goldberg, Editor in Chief, Intermountain Jewish News</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Ancient Egypt</h2><p><p>In <i>Eyewitness: Ancient Egypt</i>, travel back in time and discover one of history's most remarkable civilizations &#x2014; from the legends of the great Pharaohs to the triumphs of the ordinary people.

By learning from the best, of course. From creating brand value to fine-tuning customer service, the folks running cartels have been attentive students of the strategy and tactics used by corporations such as Walmart, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what can government learn to combat this scourge? By analyzing the cartels as companies, law enforcers might better understand how they work&#x2014;and stop throwing away $100 billion a year in a futile effort to win the &#x201c;war&#x201d; against this global, highly organized business.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your intrepid guide to the most exotic and brutal industry on earth is Tom Wainwright. Picking his way through Andean cocaine fields, Central American prisons, Colorado pot shops, and the online drug dens of the Dark Web, Wainwright provides a fresh, innovative look into the drug trade and its 250 million customers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cast of characters includes &#x201c;Bin Laden,&#x201d; the Bolivian coca guide; &#x201c;Old Lin,&#x201d; the Salvadoran gang leader; &#x201c;Starboy,&#x201d; the millionaire New Zealand pill maker; and a cozy Mexican grandmother who cooks blueberry pancakes while plotting murder. Along with presidents, cops, and teenage hitmen, they explain such matters as the business purpose for head-to-toe tattoos, how gangs decide whether to compete or collude, and why cartels care a surprising amount about corporate social responsibility.<br>More than just an investigation of how drug cartels do business, <em>Narconomics</em> is also a blueprint for how to defeat them.<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2016:</strong> Chances are when you hear someone talking about the drug trade what comes to mind is an image from T.V. or the movies&#x2014;seedy dealers, million-dollar busts, films like <em>Traffic</em> and shows like <em>The Wire</em>. In <em>Narconomics</em>, author Tom Wainwright looks at the drug business as...a business. And it&#x2019;s fascinating. We already know how internet shopping has changed the way people buy and sell goods, but in the course of his research Wainwright learned that all manner of illegal drugs are increasingly being bought and sold online, too. Interesting, right? Just wait until you read how customer service and product quality have been impacted by this change... And this is just one of the many ways in which an economist&#x2019;s view paints a very different picture than the one we&#x2019;re used to seeing. Wainwright&#x2019;s fresh look at a decades-old problem shows not only how the narcotics industry is run, but also how the &#x201c;war on drugs&#x201d; could be more effective if law enforcement started thinking about the drug business as just another corporate jungle. <em>--Seira Wilson</em><strong>Tom Wainwright</strong> formerly the <em>Economist</em>'s reporter in Mexico City, where he covered Mexico, Central America and the United States border region, is now the magazine's Britain editor.

But in private, she was something more: a brilliant inventor. And for many years only her closest friends knew her secret. Now Laurie Wallmark and Katy Wu, who collaborated on Sterling&#x2019;s critically acclaimed picture-book biography <i>Grace Hopper: Queen of Computer Code</i>, tell the inspiring story of how, during World War Two, Lamarr developed a groundbreaking communications system that still remains essential to the security of today&#x2019;s technology.</p><p>Laurie Wallmark has degrees in Biochemistry from Princeton University, Information Systems from Goddard College, and Writing for Children and Young Adults from the Vermont College of Fine Arts.

Bombshell actress Hedy Lamarr was worshipped for her beauty and elegance, but what the public didn't know was that she was an inventor. Interspersing descriptions of her various inventions and Lamarr's own words, the straightforward text and appealing, appropriately retro-feeling illustrations present a wide-eyed Lamarr as a multifaceted talent and portray both her life as a Hollywood star and her inquisitiveness and intellectual creativity, from her childhood in Austria through her acting heyday to her recognition as an inventor in her 80s. In this clear, appealing tale of an unsung heroine, Wallmark does not explicitly discuss the second-class status of female scientists but instead focuses on her subject's personality and achievements. The process of invention and inspiration are explained in a succinct and inspiring way, as is Lamarr's working partnership with composer and inventor George Antheil; their invention is relevant and used frequently in technology today. Fifty years later, Lamar is recognized, and her response forms the book's conclusion: &#x2018;It's about time.&#x2019; Wu's illustrations focus on the book's white principals but include secondary characters of color, neatly shifting mode to help illustrate the technological principles under discussion. The extensive backmatter includes a timeline, bibliography, further reading&#x2014;and, emblematic of the subject, a description of Lamarr's invention and a list of her films. Revelatory to young audiences in more ways than one.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i><br><br> &#x201c;Even readers who don't know Hedy Lamarr, &#x2018;the world&#x2019;s most beautiful woman,&#x2019; will become fans after learning how she balanced her fame as a 1930s movie star with a passion for science and inventing. Growing up in Austria, Lamarr acted in plays and explored mechanics before making it big in Hollywood. Both her artistic and scientific processes, success, and challenges are shown as the book focuses on her creation of a secure torpedo guidance system using &#x2018;frequency-hopping,&#x2019; a technology that, though ignored during its initial inception, is found in many personal electronics today. <b>Strong digital art, spread across colorful pages with varied layouts, is both dignified and fun, with diagrams of scientific principles placed near portraits of Lamarr's famous costars</b> (Clark Gable, Judy Garland). Consistent in style and substance with the duo's previous <i>Grace Hopper: Queen of Computer Code</i> (2017), this includes helpful back matter and featured quotes that offer insight into Lamarr&#x2019;s perspective: in her unique life, she never failed to &#x2018;do good . . . think big . . . [and] build.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> &#x201c;For Austrian-born actress Hedy Lamarr, promoted during her Hollywood Golden Age reign as &#x2018;the world&#x2019;s most beautiful woman,&#x2019; making movies was a day job. A childhood passion for tinkering blossomed into the impulse for serious invention, and when she was off set, Lamarr retreated to her workshop. This picture book biography focuses on her acclaimed work with composer George Antheil to design and patent a &#x2018;frequency hopping&#x2019; device that would undermine an enemy&#x2019;s ability to redirect torpedoes and thus give the Allies an advantage in World War II. The patent was approved, but &#x2018;the Navy had neither the time nor the money to implement a new system during wartime. . . . Even worse, they classified the technology SECRET. This prevented anyone, including the inventors, from using it.&#x2019; After the design was declassified and the patent expired, a new generation of inventors scooped up the idea and applied it to wireless communication technology, but Lamarr and Antheil never made a penny from it, and they waited decades to receive acknowledgment of their innovation. Wallmark and Wu do a laudable job of breaking the development of &#x2018;frequency hopping&#x2019; into understandable steps, with Wallmark explaining how communication between a ship and its launched torpedo could be intercepted, and Wu demonstrating through simple visuals how shifting rapidly among frequencies is key to securing it. <b>Many STEM-for-girls biographies fan excitement over women&#x2019;s achievements, but this title actually brings the central scientific concept within middle-grade reach</b>. A closing note, a bibliography, timeline, filmography, and list for further reading are included.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x2019;s Books</i><br><br> &#x201c;This picture book biography introduces young readers to the Hollywood legend famous for her beauty and the many hit movies in which she starred throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and her passion for science and technology. <b>Lamarr&#x2019;s zeal is conveyed superbly</b>. Growing up in Austria in the 1920s, she wanted to understand how things worked. She took apart her toys to study their mechanisms and, during long walks with her father, explored subjects ranging from streetcars to the night sky. She also reenacted her favorite scenes from movies on a stage she built beneath her father&#x2019;s desk. Wallmark brings Lamarr to life by including quotes from her subject. During World War II, Lamarr worked with another inventor on technology called frequency hopping, which is still in use today and allows users to send and receive secure cell phone messages and protect computers from hackers. The back matter includes a spread detailing frequency hopping in more depth. Vibrant digital artwork expands upon the text by showcasing a handful of Lamarr&#x2019;s other inventions and using period details to convey the golden era of Hollywood. VERDICT A must for both school and public libraries, especially where collections are looking to increase their STEM holdings and round out biography collections with women working in science.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i><br><br> &#x201c;Laurie Wallmark&#x2019;s lively biography also explains Lamarr&#x2019;s most brilliant idea (conceived with the composer George Antheil), which improved the guidance system for torpedoes and led to today&#x2019;s wireless communications.

One of the best-selling children&#x2019;s books of all time, this classic touch-and-feel book offers babies a playful and engaging experience, all the while creating cherished memories that will last a lifetime. This lovely gift set comes with an adorable plush bunny, perfect for gift giving.</p><p>"Here are Paul and Judy. They can do lots of things. You can do lots of things, too." <i>Pat the Bunny</i> is the original interactive, multimedia experience for kids. Virtually unchanged since its introduction in 1940, the kind tone and sweet illustrations in this classic recall a bygone era, while the simple language and large print invite kids to get interested in the written word as an invitation to thought and action. Each page shows Paul or Judy involved in an activity--playing peekaboo, smelling flowers, and, of course, patting the bunny--and then guides the reader to do the same. On the pages are a scrap of cloth with Paul hiding underneath (peekaboo), fuzzy fabric (the bunny), scented paper (the flowers), and five other now-famous features that invite a child to play with the book. As one of the bestselling children's books of all time, <i>Pat the Bunny</i> has become a tradition passed from one generation to the next to instill a love of books and reading. This gift set includes the book and a soft, baby-safe velour bunny toy that is loyal to the quirky bunny illustration in the book. Baby will love to take bunny along when the book has to go back on the shelf. (From birth) <i>--Katherine Ferguson</i>This book and plush set is a wonderful gift for parent and child that extends the interactive experience with a soft cuddly plush.</p><h2>Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives</h2><p>For every woman who wants to know what her man is thinking. <p> Internationally syndicated radio superhost and columnist, controversial psycho-therapist, and author of the break-out <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>How Could You Do That?!</em> and <em>Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives,</em> Dr. Laura Schlessinger is back with <em>Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives.</em> </p><p> In ten vital, compelling chapters, Dr. Laura speaks her mind on:</p><ol> <strong></strong><li><strong> Stupid Chivalry</strong><br> By getting involved with the wrong woman (weak, flaky, damaged, needy, desperate, stupid, untrustworthy, immature, etc.) you think that your love will save/transform her. <p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Independence </strong><br> Unwilling to admit "need" for bonding and intimacy, you hide in excesses of work, play, drink, drugs, porn, and meaningless sex. <p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Ambition </strong><br> Unable to comfortably and proudly accept your inherent importance to society and family as husband and father, you bow to the false idols of money, toys, power, and status. <p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Strength </strong><br>Uncomfortable with feeling weak, vulnerable, useless, powerless, or rejected, you use intimidation, force, or passive-aggressiveness to regain control.<p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Sex </strong><br>Taking an attraction, opportunity, or erection as a "sign," you measure your masculinity and power by sexual conquests, infidelities, and orgasms.<p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Matrimony </strong><br>Lacking a mature sense of the purpose, meaning, or value of marriage, you realize too late you've gone down the aisle with the wrong woman for the wrong reasons and feel helpless to "fix it." <p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Husbanding</strong><br>Thinking that marriage is the honorable discharge from loving courtship, you continue to live as though you were single and your "mommy-wife" will take care of everything else. <p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong>Stupid Parenting</strong><br>Believing that only women/mothers nurture children, you withdraw from hands-on parenting to assert your masculine importance, missing out on the true "soul food" of a child's hug. <p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong> Stupid Boyishness</strong><br>Having not yet worked out a comfortable emotional and social understanding with your mother, you form relationships with women that become geared to avenge, resolve, or protect you from your ties to Mommy.<p><strong></strong></p></li><li><strong> Stupid Machismo</strong> <br>Understanding the true and meaningful difference between being male and a man, you can become a man.</li></ol></p><p>Everything will be okay ... once you admit that Dr. Laura's always right. This companion volume to the radio advice factory's 1994 bestseller (which tackled the stupid things women do) serves up plenty of the no-nonsense, old-fashioned morality that her legions of listeners love. Brutally reductive--but not necessarily wrong--this book chalks up men's problems to trying to save "damsels in distress," refusing to admit to a healthy dependence on others, climbing the career ladder to the detriment of your relationships, denying the duty and pleasure of child-rearing, and many others. Whatever your personal reaction to her brassy, unapologetic style, Dr. Schlessinger is a refreshing antidote to the wishy-washy "everything's relative and everyone's different" trend that held sway for a time. <i>Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess up Their Lives</i> contains a lot of good advice--even though it has as much in common with instant soup mix as with therapy.<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist, is one of the most popular talk-show hosts in radio history and the only woman to win the prestigious Marconi Award for syndicated radio. She is the author of twelve <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, writes a daily blog, and is a regular <em>Newsmax</em> columnist. She is heard daily on Sirius/XM Channel 155 live, and her program is streamed and podcast on www.drlaura.com. Dr. Schlessinger has her own YouTube Channel (YouTube.com/drlaura).

Examining Irish politics, society, culture and economic history, Thomas Bartlett traces the long evolution of the two Irish states which emerged in the early twentieth century as well as the problems that confront them both in the twenty-first century.Thomas Bartlett is Professor of Irish History at the School of Divinity, History and Philosophy, University of Aberdeen. His previous publications include The Fall and Rise of the Irish Nation: The Catholic Question, 1690-1830 (1992), A Military History of Ireland (1996, with Keith Jeffery) and Revolutionary Dublin: The Letters of Francis Higgins to Dublin Castle, 1795-1801 (2004).</p><h2>28 Days: Moments in Black History that Changed the World</h2><p><p>Each day features a different influential figure in African-American history, from Crispus Attucks, the first man shot in the Boston Massacre, sparking the Revolutionary War, to Madame C. J. Walker, who after years of adversity became the wealthiest black woman in the country, as well as one of the wealthiest black Americans, to Barack Obama, the country's first African-American president.</p><p>With powerful illustrations by Shane Evans, this is a completely unique look at the importance and influence of African Americans on the history of this country.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Smith Jr.</b> is a celebrated author, poet, and photographer. He has created more than twenty books, including award-winning book <i>Twelve Rounds to Glory: The Story of Muhammad Ali</i> and <i>Black Jack: The Ballad of Jack Johnson</i><i>. </i>He currently lives in Poughkeepsie, New York, with his wife, Gillian, and three kids, Sabine, Adrian, and Sebastian. <br><b>Shane W. Evans </b>has illustrated numerous books for children, including <i>Black Jack: The Ballad of Jack Johnson,</i> <i>Underground</i>, winner of the Coretta Scott King Award, and <i>We March, </i>recipient of three starred reviews and named a Jane Addams Honor Book, all for Roaring Brook Press. He lives with his family in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Smith tells readers in an author's note that he has "always had a love-hate relationship with Black History Month." Together with Evans, he presents 28 brief descriptions of crucial people or events in black history, ranging from 1770 to the present. Text formats include poetry, quotations, eulogies, and plays on numbers (a countdown recognizes astronauts Guion Bluford and Mae Jemison). The poetry stands out for its use of concrete form (the poem about tennis players Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe bounces across the page) and its wordplay (singer Marian Anderson's poem incorporates one of her best-known songs). Expanding on Evans's highly textured Underground: Finding the Light to Freedom (Roaring Brook, 2011) and other works, the collage-style art matches line and color palettes to the mood of each event (for example, Martin Luther King Jr. is shown speaking against a background of outward-expanding lines of yellows and oranges). The physical book sometimes becomes part of the illustration, as when the gutter separates a black family from a white one on the pages about the separate but equal doctrine, and the boundaries between words and pictures are sometimes blurred, as when Jackie Robinson literally hits words such as inequality and prejudice out of the park. A final 29th day challenges readers to make history for themselves, and a bibliography invites further exploration. Highly recommended as a reference book, an example of poetic forms, and a work of art.&#x2014;Jill Ratzan, I. L.

How do we move from the current reality in most cites&#x2014;separated uses and lengthy commutes in single-occupancy vehicles that drain human, environmental, and community resources&#x2014;to support a soft city approach?<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Soft City</i> David Sim, partner and creative director at Gehl, shows how this is possible, presenting ideas and graphic examples from around the globe. He draws from his vast design experience to make a case for a dense and diverse built environment at a human scale, which he presents through a series of observations of older and newer places, and a range of simple built phenomena, some traditional and some totally new inventions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sim shows that increasing density is not enough. The soft city must consider the organization and layout of the built environment for more fluid movement and comfort, a diversity of building types, and thoughtful design to ensure a sustainable urban environment and society.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Soft City</i> begins with the big ideas of happiness and quality of life, and then shows how they are tied to the way we live. The heart of the book is highly visual and shows the building blocks for neighborhoods: building types and their organization and orientation; how we can get along as we get around a city; and living with the weather. As every citizen deals with the reality of a changing climate, <i>Soft City</i> explores how the built environment can adapt and respond.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Soft City</i> offers inspiration, ideas, and guidance for anyone interested in city building. Sim shows how to make any city more efficient, more livable, and better connected to the environment.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Architect David Sim is partner and creative director at Gehl, where he has worked for more than 15 years. He has developed citizen-engagement tools and a people-first approach to planning and flexible frameworks for development. David is an accomplished educator, teaching all over the world. He spent seven years at Lund University reforming architectural education towards a more holistic approach.<br><br> He has worked on numerous plans from transit areas in Tokyo to an urban planning framework for city recovery in Christchurch, New Zealand after the 2011 earthquake, and is currently working on a masterplan for St Saveur, a new part of Lille in France.<br> &nbsp;"In <i>Soft City</i>, David Sim draws from his great experience working on projects on all continents and in all cultures. You will benefit from his outstanding ability to see, to observe, and to reflect upon the scenes from life and cities. <i>Soft City</i> is an important addition to the growing literature on people-friendly architecture and city planning. Indeed, architecture and city planning need to be quite a bit more soft. Here is a good place to start."

Malbrough. <br> <br>When the world was Pagan, people presented offerings to the deities along with petitions and prayers. Often this involved a bonfire or flame from an oil lamp or candle. Christianity brought its own version of the deities, but some systems such as Santeria, Condomble, and Voudun refused to abandon the old gods and goddesses. They worshiped them under the guise of the Christian saints. <br> <br>The saints took on the characteristics of the Pagan deities with special days of the week, candles of a particular color, and rulership over certain problems and occupations. The belief in a saint's ability to intercede on the petitioner's behalf continues among many people to this day. Now you can find out how to use ancient techniques to call on the saints for help when you read <i>The Magical Power of the Saints. <br> <br></i>In <i>The Magical Power of the Saints </i>you will find a guide to seventy-four saints and their attributes. Learn how to evoke them for practical help in your life through prayer, candle burning, and divination. Whether you want more peace, a new love, a better job, more money, or any of several dozen more goals, you can start by getting <i>The Magical Power of the Saints. <br> <br></i><p>Ray T. Malbrough was born in New Orleans and was raised in the "Pays des Cajuns" Region of southeastern Louisiana.

This brief look at the author's unique experience and credentials sheds light upon the origins of this highly unusual work.Section 2 lays out and defines the basic conceptual building blocks needed to construct My Big TOE's foundation. It discusses the cultural beliefs that trap our thinking into a narrow and limited conceptualization of reality, defines the basics of Big Picture epistemology and ontology, logically infers the nature of time, space, and consciousness as well as describes the basic properties, purpose, and mechanics of our reality.BOOK 2: DISCOVERY Section 3 explains the characteristics, origins, dynamics, and function of human consciousness.It derives our larger purpose and the psi uncertainty principle as it interrelates psi phenomena, free will, love, consciousness evolution, reality, entropy and physics.Section 4 lays out an operational and functional model of consciousness. Our physical universe, our science, and our perception of a physical reality are logically derived. The mind-matter dichotomy is solved as physical reality is directly derived from the nature of digital consciousness.BOOK 3: INNER WORKINGS Section 5 presents the formal reality model in detail. In this section the mechanics of reality are explained. You will find out how the past, present, and future are formed, how they can be altered, and how you interact with the larger reality as an individuated unit of consciousness.Here you will find an explanation of inter and intra dimensional awareness and a discussion of the theoretical possibilities of teleportation and time travel.Section 6 provides the wrap-up that puts everything discussed into an easily understood perspective. Additionally, Section 6 points out My Big TOE's relationship with contemporary science and philosophy.ABOUT THE AUTHOR Tom Campbell began researching altered states of consciousness with Bob Monroe (Journeys Out Of The Body, Far Journeys, and The Ultimate Journey ) at Monroe Laboratories in the early 1970s where he and a few others were instrumental in getting Monroe's laboratory for the study of consciousness up and running. For the past thirty years, Campbell has been focused on scientifically exploring the properties, boundaries, and abilities of consciousness.During that same time period, he has excelled as a working scientist &#x2013; a professional physicist dedicated to pushing back the frontiers of cutting edge technology, large system simulation, technology development and integration, and complex system vulnerability and risk analysis. Presently, and for the past twenty years, he has been at the heart of developing US missile defense systems.My Big TOE represents a model of existence and reality that is based directly on Campbell's scientific research and first hand experience. It represents the results and conclusions of thirty years of careful scientific exploration of the boundaries and contents of reality from both the physical and metaphysical viewpoints. There is no belief system, dogma, creed, or unusual assumptions at the root of My Big TOE.See Author&#39;s Bio given for the individual books</p><h2>Junior: Writing Your Way Ahead In Advertising</h2><p><b>There are a lot of great advertising books, but none that get down in the dirt with you quite like this one.

The entire book is told in a story-like format, so it often goes down much like reading a collection of short stories.<br><br> The lessons and principles in The Richest Man In Babylon are pretty simple and to the point. The book consists of different stories back in the Babylonian days. <br><br> The Richest Man in Babylon documented everything he had learned and his progress on clay tablets, which were later found in the 1930&#x2019;s by archaeologists and professors at a university. These professors had then learned of these principles and applied them to their own lives, to also become wealthy and financially abundant.</p><p>George Samuel Clason was a soldier, businessman and writer, today best known for his success classic The Richest Man in Babylon. Long ago, Babylon was the richest city in the world, with lavish houses, palaces and huge city walls; the Babylonians used irrigation to create fertile farmland where once there had been desert. But, according to Clason, Babylon was also the cradle of modern finance: money as the means of exchange and all forms of lending and borrowing were all highly developed. Its inhabitants were allowed to make money freely, and the prosperity of the city continued for centuries. That&#x2019;s why Clason chose to place his short stories in Babylon. Through his pamphlets he wanted to demonstrate the unchanging principles of finance and wealth-building. The message he sends is that saving, investing and financial propriety are equally as important as setting goals, a strong work ethic, and an optimistic attitude.</p><h2>The Girl of Fire and Thorns</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Rae Carson has proved she&#x2019;s a master and has shaken up the YA genre.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>USAToday.com</em></strong></p><p><strong>The first book in Rae Carson&#x2019;s award-winning and <em>New York Times</em>&#x2013;bestselling trilogy! <em>The Girl of Fire and Thorns</em> is a sweeping journey full of adventure, sorcery, heartbreak, and power.

He demonstrates spattering, blending backgrounds, painting horizons, finger painting clouds and foam. There is expert advice on the anatomy of waves and how they rise and collapse, creating ripples, surf, foam and spray. Clear instructions show how to paint effective reflections and beaches to improve your seascapes. The sky section shows effective techniques for painting all types of cloud, with some innovative methods such as tipping up the surface to let dilute paint run, to create cirrus clouds. Dave&#39;s method of creating depth in sea, beach and sky using lines projected from the vanishing point will radically improve readers&#39; seascapes. There is a section of moods and sunsets full of beautiful, dramatic examples. Finally three step by step projects show how to paint a beach panorama with a rolling wave, a spectacular sunset over a calm sea and waves crashing on rocks.</p><p>After 30 years of being in finance, Dave White discovered he could paint, and recognising that we all have creative gifts inside us, bursting to get out, he embarked on a new road of painting people&#39;s animals and teaching students how to do it. He exhibits annually at Crufts Dog Show and the New Forest Show, and has done numerous commissions all over the world. Living in the New Forest in England allows an up-close encounter with a variety of animals, including horses and dogs.Living near the coast in Hampshire, Dave White finds constant inspiration from the sea and skies around him, and in his latest book, sea and sky in acrylics, he shares with us some of the essential elements off of capturing a subject that is constantly moving and changing. Using his preferred medium of acrylics he opens the book with a brief description of the materials you will need, then moves swiftly on to colour and the specific colours you will need to follow the demonstrations in this book, including colour mixes for sky, sea, rocks and beaches for example. The first part concentrates on the sea, describing the techniques to create the rising and falling waves, show wind direction, ripples splashes and reflections. The middle section looks at the sky; clouds, moods and sunsets; then the rest of the book is devoted to projects - a beach panorama, a sunset and waves crashing on the rocks - all with excellent step-by-step diagrams and clear photography. * The Leisure Painter * January 2016 Painting the sea is one of the greatest challenges for the artist. Constantly in motion, it has far more substance than other types of water that simply flow, or are completely still. To freeze a moment in time while still maintaining that sense of fluidity is not an easy thing to do. Almost all books on painting the sea tend at some point to be a trifle dramatic, and this is no exception. Dave white includes night-time scenes, sunsets and the last rays breaking through backlit clouds, even a helicopter rescue. On waves, spray, translucency and the rather neat trick of including low flying gulls to provide scale, Dave is solidly sound. There&#39;s plenty of variety demonstrations and good solid instruction. * The Artist * Few artists can resist the temptation to introduce a bit of drama when it comes to painting the sea, and Dave White is no exception. It is, after all, a bit boring if you just paint flat calm and there&#39;s nothing like a good storm to get the juices flowing. Add a nice ripe sunset and you&#39;ll be getting through your dark greens, rich blues and deep reds like there&#39;s no tomorrow! It&#39;s perhaps unfair to start a review like that as this is one of the most thorough and useful books on painting seascapes that I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Dave White is more than sound on achieving that tricky balance between solidity and fluidity in breaking waves and I particularly like his trick of using gulls that skim the surface (as they do) to give scale. His clouds are similarly light, fluffy and ethereal without looking half-hearted or like clumps of cotton wool stuck onto a Cerulean wash. For all that, it&#39;s the drama that&#39;ll strike you on a quick flick through, but you shouldn&#39;t let it put you off. The sea is dramatic and, as I hinted earlier, it should be. Some of the treatments here are a bit over the top for me but, equally, they might be just what you want. In terms of technique and presentation, though, this one&#39;s hard to beat. * Artbookreview.net * It&#39;s difficult for many painters to achieve realistic looking skies and water. Dave demonstrates how to paint both so that you can refine your skills. Simple techniques that any can follow. Take a closer look at waves and cloud formations, I really enjoyed these two sections. There are three step-by-step projects and examples of finished work. Discover how to add a little drama to your acrylic paintings. * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk *</p><h2>The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree</h2><p><p><strong>A Newbery Honor Book that the <em>New York Times</em> called "an eerie delight," <em>The Wish Giver </em>is an engaging&nbsp;literary folk&nbsp;story&nbsp;about those who get what they wish for&#x2014;whether they want it or not.</strong></p><p>The people of Coven Tree are no strangers to magic.

Evette was born in South Africa and grew up in Namibia, West Africa. She then moved to Australia, lived in Vanuatu and Bali. She is best known for her work in helping people to resolve trauma from their past and freeing them to live successful and fulfilling lives. Evette&#39;s work is drawn from her own personal experience of moving from a difficult past into a well-balanced life and career. Evette&#39;s philosophy is that we, as a human race, are not destined to live our lives in pain due to past trauma or abuse. Humans often suppress their ability to complete or heal trauma naturally. In today&#39;s society we often suppress our pain in order to keep up with life and avoid being left behind. Fortunately, through gentle therapy, this natural internal healing instinct can be restored. Writing her books has helped Evette reach out to other people who are in need of love, support, and someone to relate to. She shares her experiences with the world in hopes that it will help people heal and provide encouragement and reassurance when they need it most.

Spanning from the 15th century through the 18th century, the witch-hunt frenzy marks a period of suppressed rational thought; never before have so many been so wrong. To better understand this phenomenon, Robbins examines how the meaning of "witch" has evolved and exposes the true nature of witchcraft&#x2014;a topic widely discussed in popular culture, though remarkably misunderstood.</p> <p>First published in 1959, Robbins' encyclopedia remains the most authoritative and comprehensive body of information about witchcraft and demonology ever compiled in a single volume. Lavishly acclaimed in academic and popular reviews, this full-scale compendium of fact, history, and legend covers about every phase of this fascinating subject from its origins in the medieval times to its last eruptions in the 18th century. Accompanying the text are 250 illustrations from rare books, contemporary prints, and old manuscripts, many of which have been published here for the first time.</p> <p><b>Rossell Hope Robbins</b> (1912-1990), an acknowledged authority on witchcraft, was one of the half-dozen Americans ever elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He authored over a dozen books and nearly 200 articles, including the definitive introduction to the catalogue of the Witchcraft Collection at Cornell University Library in 1979. He was a Commonwealth Fellow, Canada Council Professor, and he received grants from the Modern Language Association of America and from the American Council of Learned Societies. He also served as Chairman of the Middle English Division of the MLA, President of the Medieval Club of New York, research associate at Harvard and Columbia Universities. Robbins has lectured extensively on medieval topics and witchcraft at universities throughout the world.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Step-by-Step Guide to a Florida Native Yard</h2><p><p>More and more Florida residents are deciding to replace highly fertilized, over-watered, pesticide-dependent lawns with native plants. They want to reduce their carbon footprints; save time, water, and money; and attract birds and butterflies. But where to begin? This illustrated guide will help you create new outdoor spaces that are both sustainable and beautiful.</p><p>Taking the common &#x2153;-acre lot as an example, Ginny Stibolt and Marjorie Shropshire provide a sample layout for a basic native plant landscape. They use a grid system that allows gardeners to work on their yards in small sections instead of trying to revamp the entire landscape at once. The grid system can also be reduced or expanded for yards of varying size. By breaking down the process into individual steps, creating a Florida garden is achievable for beginners and experts alike.</p><p>The first step is assessing your property and choosing which plants to keep and which to remove. Then, design your landscape to soak up more stormwater through the use of rain barrels, rain gardens, or ponds. The next steps involve planting trees, understory plants, and installing butterfly gardens. There are additional instructions for building wild areas into your landscape to provide habitat for birds and pollinators; creating a flexible outdoor "room" perfect for your family&#x2019;s needs today and into the future; and using plants to cool the air, provide screening for privacy, buffer incoming winds, and reduce noise.</p><p>By following these methods, anyone can convert all or part of their yard into a more natural area without using pesticides or artificial fertilizers, which will save money, reduce pollution, and help support wildlife. Complete with detailed diagrams, a timeline for growth and maintenance, and lists of suggested plants for each step, this guide will help readers set up an environmentally friendly habitat and give them the time and peace of mind to enjoy it.</p></p><p><b>Ginny Stibolt</b>, a freelance writer, botanist, and experienced gardener, is the author of <i>The Art of Maintaining a Florida Native Landscape and Sustainable Gardening for Florida</i>, and coauthor of <i>Organic Methods for Vegetable Gardening in Florida</i>."Takes the mystery out of transforming the common urban landscape into a true Florida paradise filled with wildlife activity and native colors and textures.

Nearly every household in America was tuned in to the election feeds, and every update pointed to a loss for the Republican Party. But when the map of the states flipped red in the final hour, there were a select few who weren't surprised. They had always known Trump was going to win. He was chosen for such a time as this. The prophecy had said so.<br> This prophet, this reserved man of God, was retired firefighter Mark Taylor. The word given by the Holy Spirit was delivered on April 28, 2011, years before Trump's victory. The election, however, was only the beginning. <br> In this UPDATED AND EXPANDED release of The Trump Prophecies, Defender Publishing revisits what the Lord revealed to Mark Taylor in both the celebrated "Commander-In-Chief Prophecy" that played such a key role in bolstering Trump's 2016 win, as well as many other messages the Holy Spirit inspired Taylor to write about what would transpire next for the most powerful nation on earth today. <br> Fast forward... Halfway into Trump's first term, have Taylor's prophecies come true? Is Trump who he said he was, and is he delivering on the promises he made during his campaign? And what of the other prophecies God gave Mark regarding economics, criminal justice, leadership turnover in the Supreme Court, and several other specific details? Have all of these inspired writings carried equal reliability as "Commander-In-Chief"?<br> So far, Mark Taylor is batting a thousand. <br><br> In <i>THE TRUMP PROPHECIES, UPDATED AND EXPANDED</i>, readers will discover: <br> *Which of Mark Taylor's prophecies have already been fulfilled<br> *How the Lord can and will use anyone regardless of education, background, or health to communicate His message to the Church of Christ <br> *What led to the miracle of the 2016 election, the role of we the people for the will of God in the future, and what the Body of Christ needs to do to keep His blessing on our nation <br> *How the enemy has utilized techniques of distraction to keep the Body's focus off of God and onto internal, demoralizing disputes, and how this can be overcome <br> *The positive message of hope and encouragement that points to fresh methods of spreading the Gospel to the lost<br></p><p></p><h2>On Language: Chomsky&#39;s Classic Works Language and Responsibility and Reflections on Language in One Volume</h2><p><p>Described by the <i>New York Times</i> as &#x201c;arguably the most important intellectual alive,&#x201d; Noam Chomsky is known throughout the world for his highly influential writings on language and politics.

LinkedIn is one of those companies. Since its founding more than a decade ago, it has become the place where professionals build, maintain, and nurture their networks. For millions of people from all over the globe, LinkedIn is a source of opportunities, talent, even inspiration. <p></p> But its founder, Reid Hoffman, isn&#x2019;t content with merely building a hugely successful company. He&#x2019;s also established himself as one of the most interesting thinkers in Silicon Valley. His first book, The Start Up of You, written with longtime collaborator Ben Casnocha, encouraged individuals to think of themselves as entrepreneurs, even if they were collecting a W-2 paycheck. <p></p> Now Hoffman and Casnocha (with Chris Yeh) are back with a new book, which takes a smart, fresh, (and occasionally bracing) look at the evolving relationship between the bosses and the bossed. It&#x2019;s a terrific and accessible read that provides business leaders with both insights and tools to handle a world in which talent is paramount. <p></p> <b>Pink:</b> One of the many things I like about The Alliance is that you take on the notion that successful companies are &#x201c;families.&#x201d; Explain. <p></p> <b>Hoffman / Casnocha / Yeh:</b> Some CEOs like to refer to their companies as families. The concept of family is a powerful one, and describes how the best companies treat their people: with compassion and respect. Yet we believe that using family language is a big mistake. The problem is that families are permanent--you can't fire your kids, no matter how many times they may forget to take out the trash. Companies are not permanent. The instant you lay off an underperforming employee, or someone leaves to pursue a better opportunity, the illusion of family is shattered. The only way to maintain the fiction is for people to lie to themselves and each other. <p></p> This underlying dishonesty is corrosive, and prevents the kind of trust that is necessary for a close, high-performance relationship. Both sides need to be honest with each other about the fact that the employment might not be permanent. <p></p> <b>Pink:</b> The big idea in this book is the &#x201c;tour of duty.&#x201d; How did you come up with that concept? <p></p> <b>Hoffman / Casnocha / Yeh:</b> We realized the employment relationship was broken. The family model was no longer affordable, but the opposite approach of treating every employee like a free agent doesn&#x2019;t build the high trust, collaborative relationships necessary for innovation. <p></p> Many Silicon Valley companies began using the Alliance and tour of duty frameworks as a way to manage the employer-employee relationship for the modern era. One of us (Reid) deployed it successfully when founding LinkedIn. In order to attract great people, he avoided vague talk about loyalty and instead made an explicit deal with employees: if they signed up for a tour of duty of between two to four years and made an important contribution to the business, Reid and the company would help advance their careers, preferably in the form of another tour of duty at LinkedIn, or at a different company if that's what was best for them. <p></p> This approach provided a crisp focus and a mutually agreeable time frame for discussing the employment relationship. It improved retention of great employees at LinkedIn. The paradox of the tour of duty idea is that acknowledging the fact that an employee can and might leave your company in the future improves your ability to construct a tour of duty that convinces him or her to stay. <p></p> <b>Pink:</b> How does a sense of purpose factor in to your analysis of talent and its place in modern organization? <p></p> <b>Hoffman / Casnocha / Yeh:</b> A sense of purpose matters hugely for employee engagement and effectiveness, but you don't get that through a single, company-wide mission statement. Most corporate mission statements are little loved and have little impact on the day to day task of recruiting and retaining great people. <p></p> <em>Click here to read the full interview</em><b>Reid Hoffman</b> is cofounder and Executive Chairman of LinkedIn, the world&#x2019;s largest professional network, and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Greylock.<br><br><b>Ben Casnocha</b> is an award-winning entrepreneur and bestselling coauthor, with Reid, of <i>The Start-up of You</i>.

Tied zip to zip, the game is a pitchers' duel until the Green Sox's hothead manager goes snout to snout with the dodo umpire and gets tossed out.

It's a beautiful day in Jurassic Park (ballpark, that is), and the herbivores and carnivores are taking the field for the season's final game. The crowd is enthusiastic&#x2015;and similarly extinct.

Schwartz and illustrator Steven Kellogg, who teamed up for the jubilant <i>How Much Is a Million</i>, have returned to the subject of money in <i>If You Made a Million</i>. Marvelosissimo the Mathematical Magician and his team of cheerful kids (and their multitude of animal friends) wield dusters, brooms, plungers, shovels, and cement as they take on feeding fish, dusting ducks, painting pots, transplanting trees, building bridges, and babysitting ogres. For each job, they'll be paid an appropriate amount of money. But soon the questions arise--what does that much money look like, and how can it be spent, saved, or used to pay off a loan?<p> "One dollar is worth as much as FOUR QUARTERS or TEN DIMES or TWENTY NICKELS or ONE HUNDRED PENNIES," Marvelosissimo explains, and we witness all the coins, crowding the page. How many and how high a stack is $100 in pennies? Ten thousand of them, in a stack 50-feet high, teeter precariously near a phenomenal airport where the gates are reached via tightrope. Next, Marvelosissimo takes readers to the Bank--a huge edifice complete with red carpets, carved slogans ("Save" and "Be Wise"), and frog attendants--where he explains the concepts of interest and bank loans. Grown-up text brings up the rear of the book, providing additional information on banks, interest and compound interest, checking accounts, loans, and income tax. Throughout, Kellogg's illustrations--highly detailed with silly objects, people, and animals--will keep kids' attention, but the pictures never detract from Schwartz's message that "enjoying your work is more important than money," and "making money means making choices."

It opens with a question: How would an alien scientist view our species? What would it make of our sex differences, our sexual behavior, our altruistic tendencies, and our culture? The book tackles these issues by drawing on two major schools of thought: evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory. The guiding assumption is that humans are animals, and that like all animals, we evolved to pass on our genes. At some point, however, we also evolved the capacity for culture - and from that moment, culture began evolving in its own right. This transformed us from a mere ape into an ape capable of reshaping the planet, travelling to other worlds, and understanding the vast universe of which we&#39;re but a tiny, fleeting fragment.

If you do not have<br> a jar of coffee in your kitchen, you are in a minority. Coffee is a global industry and the second largest commodity-based product; only oil beats it.<br> &nbsp;<br> More than 1,200 years ago hardworking people fought to stay awake without this stimulant until, as the story goes, a herd of curious goats and their watchful master, an Arab named Khalid, discovered this simple, life- changing substance. As his goats grazed on the Ethiopian slopes, he noticed they became lively and excited after eating a particular berry. Instead of just eating the berries, people boiled them to create al-qahwa.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sufis in Yemen drank al-qahwa for the same reasons we do today, to stay awake. It helped them to concentrate during late night Thikr (prayers in remembrance of Allah). Coffee was spread to the rest of the Muslim world by travelers, pilgrims, and traders, reaching Mecca and Turkey in the late 15th century and Cairo in the 16th century.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a Turkish merchant named Pasqua Rosee who first brought coffee to England in 1650, selling it in a coffeehouse in George-yard, Lombard Street, London. Eight years later, another coffeehouse called Sultaness Head was opened in Cornhill. Lloyd&#x2019;s of London, today a famous insurance company, was originally a coffee shop called Edward Lloyd&#x2019;s Coffee House. By 1700, there were about 500 coffeehouses in London, and nearly 3,000 in the whole of England. They were known as &#x201c;penny universities&#x201d; because you could listen and talk with the great minds of the day for the price of a coffee.<br> &nbsp;<br> The consumption of coffee in Europe was largely based on the traditional Muslim preparation of the drink. This entailed boiling the mixture of coffee powder, sugar, and water together, which left a coffee residue in the cup because it was not filtered. However, in 1683, a new way of preparing and drinking coffee was discovered, and it became a coffeehouse favorite.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cappuccino coffee was inspired by Marco d&#x2019;Aviano, a priest from the Capuchin monastic order, who was fighting against the Turks besieg- ing Vienna in 1683. Following the retreat of the Turks, the Viennese made coffee from abandoned sacks of Turkish coffee. Finding it too strong for their taste, they mixed it with cream and honey. This made the color of coffee turn brown, resem- bling the color of the Capuchins&#x2019; robes. Thus, the Viennese named it cappuccino in honor of Marco D&#x2019;Aviano&#x2019;s order. Since then, cappuccino has been drunk for its enjoyable, smooth taste.</p><h2>The Eucharist: A Bible Study Guide for Catholics</h2><p><i>"They devoted themselves to the teachings of the apostles and to the communal life, to the breaking of the bread and to the prayers"</i> -- Acts 2:42<p></p><p>It is called the "source and summit" of our Catholic faith - The Holy Eucharist.

Where is George Waldenstein?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With Mr. and Mrs. Welsch living in France for three months, Sport confiding that he has a crush on a girl at school, and the arrival of a mysterious new neighbor, who&#x2019;s going to require a whole lot of spying, Harriet already has her hands full. Then she overhears Ole Golly saying she&#x2019;s innocent&#x2014;but innocent of <i>what</i>?

Author Helen Ericson has developed an intriguing new episode in Harriet's life for her latest fans, many of whom were introduced to <i>Harriet the Spy</i>--the book--only after the movie. When Harriet's former nurse, Ole Golly (who went off to live in Montreal last year after getting married to Mr. George Waldenstein), temporarily returns to her old post in the Welsch household, Harriet is deliriously happy. Unfortunately, Ole Golly is not acting like her brisk, no-nonsense self at all, and Harriet has been instructed to "expunge" the husband from her memory. What's up? This looks like a job for our girl sleuth extraordinaire! Side plots involving Harriet's friend Sport's impending puberty and a mysterious new neighbor keep things moving along at a rapid pace, but there's no denying it: it's just not the same. Ericson captures much of Harriet's essence, but she seems to be trying too hard. And the denouement (fairly easy to figure out early on) is downright odd. Still, for those who are hungering for more Harriet, this taste serves as a nice little snack.

Americans responded w ith concerted efforts to give girls and women the attention and assistance that was long overdue. Now, after two major waves of feminism and decades of policy reform, women have made massive strides in education. Today they outperform men in nearly every measure of social, academic, and vocational well-being. <br>Christina Hoff Sommers contends that it's time to take a hard look at present-day realities and recognize that boys need help. Called "provocative and controversial . . . impassioned and articulate" ("The Christian Science M"onitor), this edition of "The War Against Boys" offers a new preface and six radically revised chapters, plus updates on the current status of boys throughout the book. <br>Sommers argues that the problem of male underachievement is persistent and worsening. Among the new topics Sommers tackles: how the war against boys is harming our economic future, and how boy-averse trends such as the decline of recess and zero-tolerance disciplinary policies have turned our schools into hostile environments for boys. As our schools become more feelings-centered, risk-averse, competition-free, and sedentary, they move further and further from the characteristic needs of boys. She offers realistic, achievable solutions to these problems that include boy-friendly pedagogy, character and vocational education, and the choice of single-sex classrooms. <br>"The War Against Boys" is an incisive, rigorous, and heartfelt argument in favor of recognizing and confronting a new reality: boys are languishing in education and the price of continued neglect is economically and socially prohibitive.</p><p><b>Christina Hoff Sommers</b> is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise institute in Washington, D.C. She has a PhD in philosophy from Brandeis University and was formerly a professor of philosophy at Clark University. Sommers has written for numerous publications and is the author of <i>Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women</i>. She is married with two sons and lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.The War Against Boys Preface to the New Edition<p></p> <br>When the first edition of The War Against Boys appeared in 2000, almost no one was talking about boys&#x2019; educational and social problems. Now it&#x2019;s hard to open a newspaper without stumbling upon references to the multiple books, articles, studies, and documentaries highlighting boys&#x2019; academic, social, and vocational deficits. So is the war over? Not yet.<br> <br>Although many educators recognize that boys have fallen far behind girls in school, few address the problem in a serious way. Schools that try to stop the trend, through boy-friendly pedagogy, literacy interventions, vocational training, or same-sex classes, are often thwarted. Women&#x2019;s lobbying groups still call such projects evidence of a &#x201c;backlash&#x201d; against girls&#x2019; achievements and believe they are part of a campaign to slow further female progress.<br> <br>The recent advances of girls and young women in school, sports, and vocational opportunities are cause for deep satisfaction. They should not, however, blind us to the large and growing cohort of poorly educated young men in our midst, boys who are going to be lost in our knowledge-based economy. To address the problem, we must acknowledge the plain truth: boys and girls are different. Yet in many educational and government circles, it remains taboo to broach the topic of sex differences. Gender scholars and experts still insist that the sexes are the same and argue that any talk of difference only encourages sexism and stereotypes. In the current environment, to speak of difference invites opprobrium, and to speak of boys&#x2019; special needs invites passionate, organized opposition. Meanwhile, one gender difference refuses to go away: boys are languishing academically, while girls are soaring.<br> <br>In the first edition of The War Against Boys, I focused primarily on how groups such as the American Association of University Women, the Wellesley Centers for Women, and the Ms. Foundation were harming our nation&#x2019;s young men. These organizations and their doctrines are still very much with us. But in this revised edition, I describe the emergence of additional boy-averse trends: the decline of recess, punitive zero-tolerance policies, myths about juvenile &#x201c;superpredators,&#x201d; and a misguided campaign against single-sex schooling. As our schools become more feelings centered, risk averse, competition-free, and sedentary, they move further and further from the characteristic sensibilities of boys.<br> <br>However, in the fourteen years since The War Against Boys was first published, England, Australia, and Canada have made concerted efforts to address the boy gap. In these countries, the public, the government, and the education establishment have become keenly aware of the increasing number of underachieving young males. In stark contrast to the United States, they are energetically, even desperately, looking for ways to help boys achieve parity. They have dozens of commissions, trusts, and working groups devoted to improving the educational prospects of boys. Using evidence and not ideology as their guide, these education leaders speak openly of male/female differences and don&#x2019;t hesitate to recommend sex-specific solutions.<br> <br>Success for Boys, for example, is an Australian program that has provided grants to 1,600 schools to help them incorporate boy-effective methods into their daily practice.1 In Great Britain, ten members of Parliament formed a Boys&#x2019; Reading Commission and published a comprehensive report in 2012.2 It offers educators a &#x201c;tool kit&#x201d; of successful practices. Paul Capon, president of the Canadian Council on Learning, acknowledges the political temptation to avoid or deny the problem of male underachievement. Still, he says, &#x201c;You have to ask what is happening, and you have to ask why. It&#x2019;s a head-in-the-sand, politically correct view to say there&#x2019;s no problem with boys.&#x201d;3 In the United States, our education establishment remains paralyzed with its head in the sand.<br> <br>The subtitle of the first edition was &#x201c;How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men.&#x201d; The emphasis on misguided&#x2014;I did not intend to indict the historical feminist movement, which I have always seen as one of the great triumphs of our democracy. But some readers took the book to be an attack on feminism itself, and my message was lost on them. In this edition, I have sought to make a clearer distinction between the humane and progressive women&#x2019;s movement and today&#x2019;s feminist lobby. That lobby too often acts as a narrow, take-no-prisoners special interest group. Its members see the world as a zero-sum struggle between women and men. Their job is to side with the women&#x2014;beginning with girls in the formative years of childhood.<br> <br>Most women, including most equality-minded women, do not see the world as a Manichean struggle between Venus and Mars. The current plight of boys and young men is, in fact, a women&#x2019;s issue. Those boys are our sons; they are the people with whom our daughters will build a future. If our boys are in trouble, so are we all.<br> <br>In the war against boys, as in all wars, the first casualty is truth. In this updated edition, I give readers the best and most recent information on &#x201c;where the boys are.&#x201d; I say who is warring against them and why; I describe the best scientific research on the issues in debate; and I show readers the high price we will pay if we continue to neglect academic and social needs of boys. I also suggest solutions.<br> <br>This book explains how it became fashionable to pathologize the behavior of millions of healthy male children. We have turned against boys and forgotten a simple truth: the energy, competitiveness, and corporal daring of normal males are responsible for much of what is right in the world. No one denies that boys&#x2019; aggressive tendencies must be mitigated and channeled toward constructive ends. Boys need (and crave) discipline, respect, and moral guidance. Boys need love and tolerant understanding. But being a boy is not a social disease.<br> <br>To appreciate the growing divide between our educational establishment and the world of boys, consider this rare entity: a boy-friendly American school. In June of 2011, I visited the Heights School, an all-male Catholic academy outside Washington, DC. As I approached, I saw a large banner that said &#x201c;Heights School: Men Fully Alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>The school is thriving. There is new construction and a population of 460 fully engaged male students, grades three through twelve. Competition is part of the everyday life of the students, and awards and prizes are commonly used as incentives&#x2014;but this competition is deeply embedded in an ethical system. The younger boys (ages eight to ten) attend class in log cabins filled with collections of insects, plants, and flowers. They memorize poetry and take weekly classes in painting and drawing. At the same time, the school makes room for male rowdiness.<br> <br>The day of my visit, the eighth-grade boys were reenacting the Roman Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, which they had studied in class. The boys had made their own swords and shields out of cardboard and duct tape, emblazoned with dragons, eagles, and lightning bolts. For more than an hour, they marched, attacked, and brawled. At one point, a group of warriors formed a classic Roman &#x201c;tortoise&#x201d;&#x2014;a formation with shields on all sides. Another battalion charged full-speed into the tortoise. Younger boys gathered on the sidelines and catapulted water balloons into the fray.<br> <br>I asked the principal if the boys ever get hurt. Not really, he said.

Sword fights, sneak water balloon attacks, and mock battles hold a special fascination for boys, but most of today&#x2019;s schools prohibit them. Play swords and shields? Those, even in miniature, invite suspension. Boys charging into each other? Someone could get hurt (and think of the lawsuits). Young males pretending to kill one another? A prelude to wife abuse. Gender scholars have spent the past twenty years trying to resocialize boys away from such &#x201c;toxic&#x201d; masculine proclivities. And a boys school? The American Civil Liberties Union has recently joined forces with a group of activist professors to expose and abolish the injustice of such invidious &#x201c;segregation.&#x201d; For them, what I saw at the Heights School is not &#x201c;men fully alive&#x201d;&#x2014;it is gender apartheid.<br> <br>The war against boys is not over.

OhioHealth Delay the Disease creator and author David Zid, along with co-founder Jackie Russell offer a highly anticipated revised edition of their original book and DVD, Delay the Disease Exercise and Parkinson s Disease. Exercise is a powerful component in the broad spectrum treatment of this diagnosis. This manual and companion DVD (included) offers updated and new fitness agendas to provide symptom-specific exercises to help improve walking, balance, flexibility, strength, multitasking, fine motor, handwriting, facial expression and voice volume. Research from this program is demonstrating improvement in functional mobility, decrease in fall risk, and reduction in depression. This evidenced-based PD wellness program demonstrates exercises for all levels of functional ability. Research is supporting that regular exercise may positively impact symptomatic management by enhancing the process of neuroplasticity (the brain s ability to reorganize and rewire by forming new nerve connections). This book and DVD guides the user to perform PD-specific exercises at home. There are suggestions for a weekly fitness routine at all levels of ability, from chair-bound to those early in the diagnosis. As part of OhioHealth s renowned neuroscience program since 2013, Delay the Disease now has the benefit of expert neurologists support, and research support from the OhioHealth Research Institute. OhioHealth is a family of not-for-profit, faith-based hospitals and healthcare organizations in Ohio whose mission is to improve the health of those we serve. The best kind of exercise to perform are activities that you like to do, are rigorous for you, and are goal-directed. In other words, practice your weakness. If you have trouble walking, practice perfect walking. If you struggle with performing a series of tasks, practice multitasking. If your handwriting is small and illegible, practice filling a space with big handwriting. Repeat perfect movement over and over and the brain will relearn it. Aerobic activity is very important in this process. It appears that the brain can best relearn a motor activity immediately after the heart rate is elevated. So make sure that you get some cardio work in every day; either in short bursts or for a prolonged period of 20-30 minutes. Use this book and DVD set to make your exercise routine task-specific, intense, regular and challenging. No matter how long you have been diagnosed, it is never too late to start exercising your ability to fight back, and never too early.</p><p>David Zid is a graduate of The Ohio State University and has been a professional fitness instructor in Columbus, Ohio, since 1997.

It chronicles the African American experience through the lives and times of one family, beginning in 1753 with the capture of Muhammed Bilal in Sierra Leone. He survives his journey to America on a slave ship to become the founder of a family, whose history The Glory Field is all about. Readers then meet one of his descendants, Lizzy, a young slave who works on a plantation in 1864 on Curry Island, South Carolina. From slavery, escape, and the Civil War, they follow the fortunes of the family to the year 1900. Then, teenaged Elijah migrates North. Chicago of the 1930s is described through the experiences of Luvenia, 16; Curry of 1964 is seen through the eyes of Tommy, also 16. The last part of the story is set in the present and focuses on Malcolm and Shep, teenaged cousins who have come to Curry from New York City for a family reunion. The decades pass swiftly and are connected by characters who appear in one segment of the saga and reappear later as survivors from the past or as memories. Each part of the story ends on a hopeful note, yet each is unfinished. Readers are left to wonder what happened to various people; sometimes an answer is provided, but more often not. The vast array of characters play out their lives challenged and beset by problems of racism, poverty, and identity. The anchors in their lives are family and their love for one another and their land.

The cold-blooded street murder of young Henry Marrow by an ambitious, hot-tempered local businessman and his kin in the Spring of 1970 would quickly fan the long-flickering flames of racial discord in the proud, insular tobacco town into explosions of rage and street violence. It would also turn the white Tyson down a long, troubled reconciliation with his Southern roots that eventually led to a professorship in African-American studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison--and this profoundly moving, if deeply troubling personal meditation on the true costs of America's historical racial divide. Taking its title from a traditional African-American spiritual, Tyson skillfully interweaves insightful autobiography (his father was the town's anti-segregationist Methodist minister, and a man whose conscience and human decency greatly informs the son) with a painstakingly nuanced historical analysis that underscores how little really changed in the years and decades after the Civil Rights Act of 1965 supposedly ended racial segregation. The details are often chilling: Oxford simply closed its public recreation facilities rather than integrate them; Marrow's accused murderers were publicly condemned, yet acquitted; the very town's newspaper records of the events--and indeed the author's later account for his graduate thesis--mysteriously removed from local public records. But Tyson's own impassioned personal history lessons here won't be denied; they're painful, yet necessary reminders of a poisonous American racial legacy that's so often been casually rewritten--and too easily carried forward into yet another century by politicians eagerly employing the cynical, so-called "Southern Strategy." <i>--Jerry McCulley</i>"Daddy and Roger and 'em shot 'em a nigger." Those words, whispered to ten-year-old Tim Tyson by a playmate, heralded a firestorm that would forever transform the tobacco market town of Oxford, North Carolina.<p>On May 11, 1970, Henry Marrow, a twenty-three-year-old black veteran, walked into a crossroads store owned by Robert Teel and came out running.

But she has to admit, none of them approach her to ask questions, and none of them try to get close to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch a glimpse of the body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It never occurs to Anna Gomez that this is because they are all well aware of what a body looks like.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter One</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night, almost all the people in Midnight went up the steps to gather in the pawnshop owned by Bobo Winthrop, owner and proprietor, who worked the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day shift there.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Midnight Pawn was a very old store with wooden floors that creaked in a friendly way. It was crowded with many curious items. The big open area at the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; front of the shop was hospitably full with chairs of all descriptions and ages, which made it made a natural meeting place. The counter, with its high<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stool, was to the left, parallel to the wall. Normally, that was where Bobo sat when there were customers.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when there weren&#x2019;t, like tonight, Bobo sat in his favorite velvet chair. It was very old, and the velvet was worn, but Bobo found it comfortable and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stylish. He&#x2019;d positioned it to give him a good view of his domain, from the loaded shelves that held the strange discards of the human race, to the display<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases in which objects gleamed and glittered. There was a whole shelf of sanders, for example. And one of bubblegum machines. And jewelry, both real and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fabulously fake.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was one secluded corner full of magical items. Fiji Cavanaugh, the witch who lived across Witch Light Road, had suggested that Bobo let her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inspect those before they were placed on display.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight, Fiji came in first. She smiled at Bobo and found a place to sit where she could see everyone. The witch, a brown-haired woman in her late<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twenties, was literally well rounded and had lovely skin, at least in part because she kept it protected from the Texas sun.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev and his ward, Diederik, took up chairs beside Fiji. The Rev was a sparse man; short in stature, short of words, thin and bony and dry. His thinning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dark hair was combed straight back. The Rev always wore the same ensemble: a white shirt, black pants, a black coat, and a black cowboy hat and boots. He<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sported a string tie with a turquoise stone fixing it around his neck. Wearing the same ensemble every day simplified his life.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev&#x2019;s companion, Diederik, provided a sharp contrast. Diederik radiated health and vitality. The boy looked as though he were nineteen, perhaps<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entering college like Marina Desoto, but that wasn&#x2019;t so. Diederik had a broad olive face, wide violet eyes that slanted a bit, and dark thick hair. He was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; built like a wrestler, and he moved with grace.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he settled into his chair, Diederik gave Fiji a kiss on the cheek. She smiled at the boy, hoping the smile held nothing but motherly interest. When<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she&#x2019;d met him a few months ago, he&#x2019;d been a little boy. Now he was a full-grown male with a lively interest in females.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiji looked over at Olivia Charity, the only other woman present. Did Olivia, too, have a few slightly conflicted feelings about Diederik? But she sensed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olivia didn&#x2019;t; that in fact, he was barely a blip on Olivia&#x2019;s radar.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Olivia let Fiji know who she was thinking about. &#x201c;Lemuel&#x2019;s still working on those books,&#x201d; she said to Fiji, who hadn&#x2019;t asked. &#x201c;In fact, he eats,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drinks, and sleeps those damn books.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Golly,&#x201d; said Fiji, who couldn&#x2019;t think of anything more helpful to say. Lemuel could focus like a laser beam, but she&#x2019;d never seen him that concentrated on<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anything. The volumes in question had been hidden in the pawnshop for decades, and for decades Lemuel had looked for them. Then Lemuel had sold the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pawnshop to Bobo, staying on as night manager. Bobo had found the cache, not realized its importance, and moved it up to his apartment, planning to examine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the books someday. Now Lemuel had discovered he couldn&#x2019;t read the script in one, and naturally, that was the one that was most important, though Fiji<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn&#x2019;t know why.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chuy Villegas and Joe Strong, the couple who ran the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon, nodded easily to Bobo as they entered. Chuy patted Fiji&#x2019;s shoulder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diederik rose and hugged them, and scratched their dog&#x2019;s head. The two took odd chairs, side by side, and set their little Peke, Rasta, down. He snuffled<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around the room, visiting everyone in turn, and then settled by Chuy&#x2019;s feet.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manfred Bernardo, the psychic who rented the house next door from Bobo, hurried in and threw himself into a chair by his landlord. He gave everyone a wave<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a word. Manfred, almost as small and spare as the Rev, was pierced liberally and with great effect, and lately he had begun getting tattoos. He pulled<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up his T-shirt sleeve to show the new one on his left shoulder, an ouroboros, to Fiji, and she shook her head, smiling.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why volunteer for pain?&#x201d; she said.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for my art,&#x201d; Manfred said dramatically, and they all laughed. Manfred regarded the tattoo with admiration. &#x201c;Actually, I think it makes me look<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; badass.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one raised the topic of the evening.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were all waiting on Lemuel, who would be there when the sun set.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October, the sun went down a little before seven thirty p.m. One of the clocks in the pawnshop chimed the half hour, and a minute or two later, Lemuel<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridger came up from his basement apartment. There was a sense of completion when he took his place in the circle to Bobo&#x2019;s left.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two were as much of a contrast as the Rev and Diederik. Bobo always seem relaxed, and now that he was in his thirties his blond hair was a little<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faded, and his blue eyes were a little sad. But he still could have been featured in an advertising campaign for something casual but expensive, like<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunglasses. Lemuel could never pass for human. He was too white, white as bleach, and his eyes were a strange gray. He didn&#x2019;t even move like a human being.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did anyone know the man who killed himself last night?&#x201d; Fiji asked the little crowd. &#x201c;Joshua Allen, right, Manfred?&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they said on the news.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know him,&#x201d; Lemuel said. His hoarse voice was at odds with his white, gleaming appearance. &#x201c;But I knew the first one.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a moment of absolute silence.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The first one. The first what?&#x201d; Olivia said.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The first suicide.&#x201d; Lemuel&#x2019;s pale eyes went from one of them to another. If he was looking for someone to nod in agreement, he was disappointed.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiji was stumped. &#x201c;Are you looking back a decade or something?&#x201d; Vampires could lose track of time.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking back a week,&#x201d; Lemuel said, in a bored way. &#x201c;The first one was at three in the morning last Tuesday. A homeless woman stabbed herself to death<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right under the traffic light. I knew her, a little. Her name was Tabby Ann Masterson.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Olivia had not expected this bombshell. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201d; she said.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I could not imagine that it had anything to do with Midnight,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No one was awake but me.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lemuel was up all night, of course. Though the pawnshop was up a few steps from the ground level, and though he was often behind the counter, the pawnshop<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sat at the northeast corner of the only intersection in Midnight: the crossroads of Witch Light Road and the Davy highway. And from behind the counter,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lemuel could get a somewhat abbreviated view of what was happening there. If he happened to be closer to the window, his view would be unobstructed.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiji smiled to herself at the long silence. Even if Lemuel had said he&#x2019;d been facing the wall when it happened, none of them would have dared to question<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his word. Lemuel, the oldest of the town&#x2019;s inhabitants by a century, was not a joker, a kidder, or a fantasist.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met Tabby Ann,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She used to come by my place, looking for my aunt. Evidently, Great-Aunt Mildred used to give her leftovers. I gave her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some food once, but the next time I wasn&#x2019;t there, and she peed on my back porch. I cast a spell to find out who had done it, because Mr. Snuggly didn&#x2019;t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where is her body, then?&#x201d; Manfred asked. &#x201c;Tabby Ann. What did you do with her?&#x201d; There was another profound silence. &#x201c;Wait, sorry, don&#x2019;t need to know.&#x201d; He<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waved his hands, palms forward, warding off unneeded information.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lemuel smiled at Manfred, briefly. &#x201c;Tabby Ann Masterson was a homeless woman,&#x201d; Lemuel said, &#x201c;as you call it now. I knew her during her better days, when<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she had a man and children and a home. She had no one left any longer.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two suicides,&#x201d; Joe Strong, who looked exactly like his name, said. &#x201c;In the same spot, in the same town. Joshua Allen can&#x2019;t be a copycat, since he couldn&#x2019;t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have known about Tabby Ann.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Shine!</h2><p><b><b>"Inspirational, commonsensical, and a whole lot of fun." --James Patterson</b><br><br><b>Everyone deserves to shine in this sparkling new book from the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library</i></b><b>, Chris Grabenstein, and coauthor J.J.

But tonight is one of the biggest nights ever for my dad, so I&#x2019;m here to help.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad&#x2019;s singers are onstage at the Municipal Auditorium, waiting for the curtain to rise. I&#x2019;m off in the wings, dressed in black, trying to disappear.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad, Marcus Milly, is a music teacher at Fairview Middle School. His a cappella group has finally, for the first time in recorded history, by some sort of miracle, made it all the way to the biggest show in town: the finals of the Winter Sing-Off.<br> &nbsp;<br> The place is packed. The local news crews are here, too, taping reports for their eleven o&#x2019;clock broadcasts.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The finals!&#x201d; I hear the reporter from Channel 8 say into a camera. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get much closer to the big finish than that!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad&#x2019;s group sailed through the first two rounds with their mash-up of &#x201c;Let It Snow&#x201d; and &#x201c;Winter Wonderland,&#x201d; which, by the way, sounded even better on a stage sparkling with glittery spray-can snow. Now they just have to do one more song for the judges. And they&#x2019;ll do it without instruments or even a piano because that&#x2019;s what &#x201c;a cappella&#x201d; means. It&#x2019;s all vocals and schoop-schoops and mouth noises.<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t go to Fairview. (I&#x2019;m a seventh grader at Westside.)<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s a good thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Music is Dad&#x2019;s life. And even though I&#x2019;m related to the director, I don&#x2019;t sing well enough to make the Fairview choir. Or any choir.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because I can&#x2019;t carry a tune in a lunch box.<br> &nbsp;<br> At home, I don&#x2019;t even sing in the shower.<br> &nbsp;<br> And we definitely don&#x2019;t do carpool karaoke.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, like I said, Dad has never come this close to winning the big countywide holiday a cappella contest, and I&#x2019;ve never been more excited for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s why I volunteered to be his assistant and help out backstage. Dad and his singers are the main attraction. I&#x2019;m just a moon orbiting their planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is it, Piper,&#x201d; says Dad, his eyes twinkling with excitement.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got this!&#x201d; I tell him.<br> &nbsp;<br> We fist-bump on it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The curtain will go up for everybody&#x2019;s final songs in seven minutes. I can see other choirs waiting in the wings. Some are in red-and-green outfits. Others in sparkling blue and silver. The backdrop is a row of Christmas trees flanked by a cardboard menorah and a Kwanzaa candle set.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad&#x2019;s group is totally focused, doing their vocal warm-ups.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah-oh-oo-oh-ah . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They limber up their lips with a tongue twister.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly I hear a cough!<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad twirls around. Now there&#x2019;s panic in his eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> One dry throat in the soprano section could ruin everything! That&#x2019;s exactly what happened at the Nationals last year. Dad and I watched it on YouTube. A coughing fit took down the top team in the country. (A girl up front was hacking so much during &#x201c;Let It Go&#x201d; that she sounded like a high-pitched Chihuahua.)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Water, Piper,&#x201d; Dad says. From the tremor in his voice, I can tell: he remembers that disaster, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Room-temperature water!&#x201d; I add, because my scientific brain knows that room-temperature water is much better for vocal cords than cold or hot.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cold water could actually hurt a singer&#x2019;s voice--tighten the cords when they need to be loosened. You don&#x2019;t want hot water, either, because it can cause your pharynx to swell slightly. You should also avoid dairy.<br> &nbsp;<br> I take off, looking for a water dispenser with one of those hot taps for making tea, so I can quickly pour the perfect mix of hot and cold to achieve room temperature. On the far side of the stage, I think I see one.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s right behind a competing a cappella group.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they&#x2019;re not doing any last-minute vocal warm-ups.<br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;re too busy pointing, laughing, and making fun of Dad and his singers!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Without You, There Is No Us: Undercover Among the Sons of North Korea&#39;s Elite</h2><p><b>A haunting account of teaching English to the sons of North Korea's ruling class during the last six months of Kim Jong-il's reign</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Every day, three times a day, the students march in two straight lines, singing praises to Kim Jong-il and North Korea: <i>Without you, there is no motherland. Without you, there is no us.</i> It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction fields&#x2014;except for the 270 students at the all-male Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has gone undercover as a missionary and a teacher. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them English, all under the watchful eye of the regime. <br><br>Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues&#x2014;evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. As the weeks pass, she is mystified by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. At the same time, they offer Suki tantalizing glimpses of their private selves&#x2014;their boyish enthusiasm, their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. She in turn begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own&#x2014;at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. But when Kim Jong-il dies, and the boys she has come to love appear devastated, she wonders whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.<br><br> <i> Without You, There Is No Us</i> offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the world's most unknowable country, and at the privileged young men she calls "soldiers and slaves."</p><p><b>Suki Kim</b> is the author of the award-winning novel&nbsp;<i>The Interpreter</i>&nbsp;and the recipient of Guggenheim, Fulbright, and Open Society fellowships.

I knew who would be there. I ignored it and continued shoving my clothes into the suitcase. The knock came again. She knew that I was inside, and she was not going to go away. Finally I stopped what I was doing and opened the door. There stood Martha, a lanky twenty-�four-�year-�old British girl with glasses, with whom I had been sharing teaching duties. &#x201c;You must come to the meeting right now,&#x201d; she said. I sighed, feeling the weight of the past six months there among thirty Christian missionaries, now gathered in secret for the pre-�Christmas prayer meeting. Then she whispered, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; pointing at the ceiling. I thought that she meant God, and I was momentarily confused. I have never read the Bible, and my family is largely atheist. Then she said, &#x201c;him,&#x201d; and I realized she meant the main God in this world: Kim Jong-�il.<br><br>Was it fate that my North Korean experience began with his birthday and ended with his death? It was February 2002 when I first glimpsed the forbidden city of Pyongyang as part of a Korean-American delegation visiting for Kim Jong-�il&#x2019;s sixtieth birthday celebrations. It was only a few months after 9/11, and George W. Bush had just christened that country part of an &#x201c;axis of evil,&#x201d; so it was an inauspicious time for a single American woman to cross its border with a group of strangers. <br><br>Over the next nine years, with each implausible crossing of its immutable border, I became further intoxicated by this unknown and unknowable place. This isolated nation existed under an entirely different system from the rest of the world, so different that when I arrived in 2011, I found myself in &#x201c;Juche Year 100.&#x201d; The Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) follows a different calendar system, which counts time from the birth of their original Great Leader, Kim Il-�sung, who died in 1994; Juche, which roughly means &#x201c;self-�reliance,&#x201d; is at the core of North Korea&#x2019;s foundational philosophy. Almost every book I ever saw there was written by or about the Great Leader. The state-�run media, including the newspaper Rodong Sinmun and Chosun Central TV, reported almost exclusively on the Great Leader. Almost every film, every song, every monument heralded the miraculous achievements of the Great Leader, the role passed down through three generations, from Kim Il-�sung and Kim Jong-�il to Kim Jong-�un, who was twenty-�nine when he assumed power in 2012 and became the world&#x2019;s youngest head of state. It has been reported that every home in the country is fitted with a speaker through which government propaganda can be broadcast, and that more than thirty-�five thousand statues of the Great Leaders are scattered across the country.<br><br>But while the regime dabbles with nuclear weapons, provoking repeated United Nations sanctions, the people of North Korea suffer. The 1990s famine (known as the Arduous March)killed as many as three million, more than a tenth of the entire population, and even now the World Food Program reports that 80 percent of North Koreans experience food shortages and hunger. It is estimated that forced labor, executions, and concentration camps have claimed over a million lives since 1948. According to the latest UN report, the DPRK maintains some twenty gulags holding some 120,000 political prisoners (Human Rights Watch estimates 200,000). These numbers are inevitably approximate since nothing there is verifiable. Almost no North Koreans are allowed out&#x2014;�defectors risk execution&#x2014;�and almost no foreigners are allowed in except those on packaged tours, most holding European passports, and they get to see only what is allowed. In this global age of information, where secrets have become an anachronism, North Korea stands apart.<br><br>My obsession with this troubling country&#x2014;�because it indeed became an obsession&#x2014;�was based on more than just journalistic interest. The first time I entered North Korea, I was not sure what a &#x201c;delegate&#x201d; was and did not know much at all about the pro&#x2013;�Kim Jong-�il group I was traveling with. This makes me sound either extremely irreverent or extremely young, but I was neither. My ignorance was willful. Since getting a visa into the country was so difficult, I thought it was best not to appear too inquisitive. But there was something else, too: a part of me, a very insistent voice inside, did not want to know those details. For those of us who grew up in 1970s South Korea, anything to do with North Korea is accompanied by a certain foreboding. And for those of us whose family members were abducted into North Korea, this fear runs still deeper. If I had known as much as I do now, more than a decade later, I doubt I would have made that first, fateful trip. But I did get on a flight from JFK, on Korean Air, one of the world&#x2019;s most modern and luxurious airlines, and then almost twenty hours later, via Seoul and then Beijing, boarded North Korea&#x2019;s state-�owned Air Koryo, where the only reading material was a magazine about the Great Leader. And I would cross that same border into Pyongyang repeatedly for the next nine years.<br><br>Every story has its origin in a time that came before. My obsession had its roots even before I was born, in 1945. It was then, when the five-�thousand-�year-�old kingdom of Korea was divided by the Allies who liberated it from Japan, that everything went wrong. And since then everything has continued to be wrong, and nothing, not even the three-�year-�long war that began in 1950, has made much difference.<br><br>Or maybe my obsession became inevitable when I was a child growing up in South Korea. The years I lived there remain unnervingly still, pristinely intact in my mind. As I get older, the memory of those years grows bigger, each nook casting a longer shadow. Such is the condition of a first-�generation immigrant for whom everything is separated into now and then, into before the move and after. The ocean that separates the adoptive home and the old country also divides time.<br><br>I was just thirteen when we came to America. The early eighties in South Korea was a time of political unrest and economic upheaval, and my father&#x2019;s businesses&#x2014;�from the shipping company and mining ventures to the hotels&#x2014;�collapsed rapidly. Bankruptcy in South Korea was punishable by a hefty jail term, and we fled our home in the dead of night. Like many new immigrants to America, my family was now poor and kept moving&#x2014;�from Queens to Jersey City to the Bronx to Fort Lee. I grasped few of the vast changes that seemed to have occurred overnight in my physical surroundings. I knew that I was no longer in Korea, and yet it was beyond my comprehension that this loss of home was permanent. Another foreign concept that took time to absorb was that I was now Asian, a term that I had heard mentioned only in a social studies class. Back home, yellow was the color of the forsythia that bloomed every spring along the fence that separated our estate from the houses down the hill; I certainly never thought of my skin as being the same shade. Those years were also marked by silence. My mother tongue was suddenly gone, replaced by unfamiliar sounds called English. It seemed a miracle when I took the SAT and made it to college.<br><br>After graduation, I spent a couple of years in London, searching for something I could never quite name, then returned to New York to a series of part-�time jobs and a rent-�stabilized apartment in the East Village, where I spent my twenties. But I never felt at home there either and kept subletting my apartment and taking off, often on meager writing fellowships that required me to live in some remote place, whether it be a hundred-�year-�old cabin in New Hampshire or an empty room facing a desert hill in Wyoming. There were no cell phones then, and I was always calling my parents collect. I remember getting off a Greyhound bus one afternoon and standing in a phone booth outside a coffee shop in Taos, New Mexico, and my father, on the line from New Jersey, ending the call with: &#x201c;If you keep moving like this, one day you&#x2019;ll be too far away to come back.&#x201d;<br><br>During those itinerant years, I once found myself on the Ligurian coast of Italy, which sounded better than it felt. It was a place whose awe-�inspiring beauty so oddly failed to touch me that for years afterward I would look for an opportunity to drop the word Liguria in conversations, such as &#x201c;I wore this dress often that autumn I was living in Liguria&#x201d; or &#x201c;I never finished that novel I was working on in Liguria,&#x201d; as if to remind myself that I had spent nearly two months there.<br><br>Some experiences are like that. You live through them, and yet you aren&#x2019;t quite there. Korea was the opposite. My first thirteen years remained real for me like nothing since. When you lose your home at a young age, you spend your life looking for its replacement. Over the years, I have never considered any apartment more than temporary. Each one remains spare, with bare walls and no personal touches&#x2014;as though I might need to grab everything in a few seconds and run. People often ask me where my things are. The question always brings me back to South Korea; in my mind, I finally return. I put down my suitcase at the base of the incredibly long flight of steps I have never forgotten and look up at my childhood home, towering above.<br><br>Strangely, in 2002, when I visited Pyongyang for the first time, I felt more at home than I had since I left Seoul as a child. There was a sense of recognition. The past was all right there before me: generations of Koreans separated by division; decades of longing, loss, hurt, regret, guilt. I identified with it in a way that I could never shake off. I thought that if only I could understand the place, then I could find a way to help put the fragments back together. Like most Koreans, whether from the North or South, I dreamed, perhaps irrationally, of reunification. I returned repeatedly until 2011.<br><br>I am often asked, &#x201c;Which Korea do you come from? North or South?&#x201d; It is a nonsensical question. The chance of me or any Korean out and about in the world being from the North is almost nil. Virtually no one gets out of North Korea. It is a locked nation. Locked away from South Korea, from the rest of the world, from those of us whose families got trapped there. It is the sort of a lock for which there is no &#x201c;open sesame,&#x201d; and the world seems to have forgotten why it was sealed tight to begin with and who threw away the key.<br><br>My Korea is the South&#x2014;�the industrial, overachieving, better half that spewed out Hyundai and Samsung and in the six decades since the bloody war has established itself as the fifteenth richest country in the world. But the South is never just the South. Its very existence conjures up the unmentionable North, which, with its habitual nuclear threats and the antics of its bizarre dictator, casts a shadow far beyond its own peninsula. In recent years, North Korea has steadily become a siren for the hankering mind, making outsiders wait and guess and then wait some more, indefinitely.<br><br>Both my parents hail from families separated by the partition. And it is really the unrequited heartbreak of those separations&#x2014;�a heartbreak that lasts generations&#x2014;�that brought me North. If this were the sort of story that invites readers to nod with empathy and walk away both satisfied and educated, I would say that I traveled full circle. But in truth my journey was barely half a circle, a sad one that could never be completed, because those who were at the center of the harrowing history are almost certainly long dead, or old and dying, and time is running out before their stories are lost in the dust of the past.<br><br>The Korean War lasted three years, with millions either dead or separated. It never really ended but instead paused in the 1953 armistice exactly where it began, with Koreas on both sides of the 38th parallel. Historians often refer to it as the &#x201c;forgotten war,&#x201d; but no Korean considers it forgotten. Theirs is not a culture of forgetting. The war is everywhere in today&#x2019;s Koreas.<br><br>There is, for example, the story of my father&#x2019;s young female cousins, nursing students aged seventeen and eighteen, who disappeared during the war. Decades later, in the 1970s, their mother, my father&#x2019;s aunt, received a letter from North Korea via Japan, the only contact her daughters ever made with her, and from that moment on, she was summoned to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency every few months on suspicion of espionage until she finally left South Korea for good and died in San Antonio, Texas. The girls were never heard from again. And there was my uncle, my mother&#x2019;s brother, who was just seventeen when he was abducted by North Korean soldiers at the start of the war, in June 1950. He was never seen again. He might or might not have been taken to Pyongyang, and it was this suspended state of not knowing that drove my mother&#x2019;s mother nearly crazy, and my mother, and to some degree me, who inherited their sorrow.<br><br>Stories such as these abound in South Korea, and probably North Korea, if its people were allowed to tell them. Separation haunts the affected long after the actual incident. It is a perpetual act of violation. You know that the missing are there, just a few hours away, but you cannot see them or write to them or call them. It could be your mother trapped on the other side of the border. It could be your lover whom you will long for the rest of your life. It could be your child whom you cannot get to, although he calls out your name and cries himself to sleep every night. From Seoul, Pyongyang looms like a shadow, about 120 miles away, so close but impossible to touch. Decades of such longing sicken a nation. The loss is remembered, and remembered, like an illness, a heartbreak from which there is no healing, and you are left to wonder what happened to the life you were supposed to have together. For those of us raised by mothers and fathers who experienced such trauma firsthand, it is impossible not to continue this remembering.</p><h2>One Piece, Vol. 67 (67)</h2><p>Join Luffy as he tries to become the king of the pirates and find the legendary treasure, One Piece!<br><br>As a child, Monkey D.

For many years the various denominations have been writing treatises bearing on their own particular work, but hitherto there has been no effort to study the achievements of all of these groups as parts of the same institution and to show the evolution of it from the earliest period to the present time. This is the objective of this volume.</p><p>Whether or not the author has done this task well is a question which the public must decide. This work does not represent what he desired to make it. Many facts of the past could not be obtained for the reason that several denominations have failed to keep records and facts known to persons now active in the church could not be collected because of indifference or the failure to understand the motives of the author. Not a few church officers and ministers, however, gladly co�perated with the author in giving and seeking information concerning their denominations. Among these were Mr. Charles H. Wesley, Prof. J. A. Booker, and Dr. Walter H. Brooks. For their valuable assistance the author feels deeply grateful.</p><p>Carter G. Woodson.<br> Washington, D.

Roche, Attorney at Law �2004<br><br>Juvenile Court is sometimes referred to by lawyers and law enforcement officers as Kiddie Court. The Juvenile Court in some jurisdictions, however, can be more than simply what the name may imply. In some jurisdictions, it may actually be a type of<br>Family Court wherein all different types of family disputes may be resolved. This chapter will not deal with family law issues, but rather simply deal with issues of juvenile justice.<br><br>The logic behind the juvenile court system in the United States is that because juveniles are underage, they should be dealt with in a different fashion than adults. In many jurisdictions, juvenile offenses are not even referred to as criminal offenses. Juvenile records in most jurisdictions are strictly confidential and are not subject to public access either by means of subpoena or other inquiry. As such, a juvenile arrested and processed through the Juvenile Court does not have to report that offense on a job application or other type of inquiry unless directly asked about it since the inquiry itself is not going to be subject to any public confirmation.<br><br>Proceedings in Juvenile Court are all conducted by a judge with no jury present. For certain types of offenses, however, a juvenile may be transferred to the adult system and may be tried as an adult with all the consequences that might apply to an adult. (That type of treatment is generally reserved for more serious offenses.)<br><br>An offense in Juvenile Court is generally handled in a somewhat informal fashion. There may be a prosecutor present in Juvenile Court. That prosecutor represents the interest of the government or the victim. The prosecutor may present evidence in front of the judge who then hears from the defense and renders a decision. That decision normally consists of a finding of whether the juvenile is involved and if so there may be some punishment imposed. That punishment may consist simply of a monetary fine, performing some community service, or for more extreme circumstances, confinement to a juvenile home for a period of time. <br><br>The thrust of the juvenile court system is to be instructive and rehabilitative-to instruct the juvenile as to the error of his or her ways and to assist him or her with rehabilitation. That is dramatically different from the thrust of the adult court system, which may have an element of rehabilitation about it, but is more oriented toward a finding of guilt or innocence and then punishing the guilty.<br><br></p><h2>Natural Health, Natural Medicine: The Complete Guide to Wellness and Self-Care for Optimum Health</h2><p>The bible of natural medicine--(Larry Dossey, M.D.), Natural Health, Natural Medicine is a comprehensive resource for everything you need to know to maintain optimum health and treat common ailments. This landmark book incorporates Dr. Weil&#39;s theories of preventive health maintenance and alternative healing into one extremely useful and readable reference, featuring general diet and nutrition information as well as simple recipes, answers to readers&#39; most pressing questions, a catalogue of home remedies, invaluable resources, and hundreds of practical tips. This new edition includes up-to-the-minute scientific findings and has been expanded to provide trustworthy advice about low-carb diets, hormone replacement therapy, Alzheimer&#39;s, attention deficit disorder, reflux disease, autism, type 2 diabetes, erectile dysfunction, the flu, and much more.</p><p>Health can be defined in any number of ways, from the simple fact that you're not lying on a hospital bed to an overall sense of well-being and connectedness. One person may not feel healthy unless he's carrying around mounds of gym-built muscle, while another doesn't feel healthy unless she's eating an intestine-scrubbing macrobiotic diet and practicing an hour of yoga each day.<p> Dr. Andrew Weil looks at every aspect of health in <i>Natural Health, Natural Medicine</i>. He's quite cynical about bodybuilding and the emphasis on protein in our diets, while making a strong case for paying more attention to the way we breathe and the degree to which we interact with family, community, and nature. An interesting--but, unfortunately, short--section on loving says that most people have no idea what to do when they fall out of romantic love with a partner, which helps explain the high divorce rate.</p><p> Other sections of the book focus on healthy self-care practices ("nasal douching" is recommended for sinus sufferers), supplements (he believes most benefits that seem to come from these are placebo responses), and natural home remedies for an A-to-Z list of problems (the section on depression states that people experience low mood because they constantly seek highs; eliminate the quest for highs, and you eliminate the rebound experience of lows).</p><p> Many regard this book as the bible of natural healing; but even those who are on the fence about alternative medicine should find it to be an entertaining, informative, and highly opinionated beginner's guide to achieving better health without conventional medicine. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Andrew Weil, M.D., has degrees in biology and medicine from Harvard University.

After sixteen-year-old Kayla Reed's father commits suicide and her best friend's family members are forced to move after receiving their bar codes, Kayla joins the resistance group Decode and refuses to get her tattoo when she turns seventeen. Readers encounter many cliffhangers as Kayla survives a house fire, escapes the hospital before getting tattooed, is accused of murdering her mother, hitchhikes to the Adirondacks, and wanders the wilderness sick with fever and desperate to avoid corporate and government enforcers and double agents her age. After joining a camp of resisters who are developing psychic abilities in response to the changing social and cultural environment, Kayla regains the strength to fight another day. The science fiction angle of the corporate/government powers using bar codes to weed out the unfit and uplift those with the least genetic flaws for future cloning is complemented with a discussion of how credit cards were the seeds of consumer tracking. A subplot of the elderly being euthanized in hospitals to save insurance costs is equally disturbing. Mixed in with such thought-provoking substance are some distracting subplots. A romantic triangle between Kayla and two classmates seems forced and used only to heighten suspense and move a plot that is already progressing well, and the conclusion involving people quickly evolving psychic abilities is under-explored. Teens will enjoy this book with its intriguing cover and suspense but might find the ending unsatisfying.-Julie Scordato.<br>School Library Journal<br>(February 1, 2005; 0-439-39562-3)<br><br>Gr 6 Up-It's 2025, and the thing to do on your 17th birthday is to get a bar code tattoo, which is used for everything from driver's licenses to shopping. Kayla, almost 17, resists because she hates the idea of being labeled. Then the tattoos begin to drive people to commit suicide, Kayla's father among them, and she soon finds out that the markings contain detailed information about their bearers, including their genetic code. When the government, controlled by a corporation called Global-1, makes the tattoo mandatory, Kayla joins a teen resistance movement and falls for a gorgeous guy, unaware that he's a double agent. She discovers she has some psychic ability and has confusing visions of future events. Forced to run away after being implicated in her mother's accidental death, she eventually joins other resisters hiding in the Adirondack Mountains, finds romance with an old friend, and learns to harness her psychic powers to fight Global-1 and fulfill her visions. Like M. T. Anderson's Feed (Candlewick, 2002), this novel examines issues of individuality versus conformity and individual freedom versus governmental control. Because it also deals with the ethics of enhanced genetics and cloning, it tries to cover too much territory and relies too heavily on coincidence and far-fetched plotting. Stick with Feed.-Sharon Rawlins, Piscataway Public Library, NJ Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.<br><br>Sarah Applegate (KLIATT Review, May 2005 (Vol. 39, No. 3))<br>In a book not far from the headlinesaWhat if people began to get bar codes tattooed on their arms for identification, for credit card purchasing, for movement around the country, for getting a job? This is the premise of The Bar Code Tattoo, a story about Kayla, a high school student who is beginning to get suspicious of what the bar codes are doing to her world. Her friend's father can't get a job, people are losing their homes, alienating their families and committing suicide, and she knows it is somehow connected to the bar codes. She joins a group working against the codes and against Global-1, the corporation behind the codes, and soon is inspired to fight the bar code--and to fall in love! In the end, Kayla finds herself unwittingly on the lam, separated from her friends and family but knowing in her heart that she is doing what is right. This is a great book, one that reminded me of one of my favorites, Feed by M.T. Anderson, though a little less futuristic. It would be an excellent tie-in to discuss contemporary issues of proposed US I.D. cards and civil rights, as well as corporate domination and centralization of ownership. Students will enjoy the multilayered story lines and some students will recognize the similarities to the book of Revelation, which, if you read the author's note, inspired the title.

This time there are two Bournes&#x2014;and one must die.</p></p><p>"A killer of a thriller." -- <i>USA Today</i>In a Kowloon Cabaret, scrawled in a pool of blood, is a name the world wanted to forget: Jason Bourne.<br><br>The Chinese vice-premier has been brutally slain by a legendary assassin. World leaders ask the same fearful questions: <i>Why has Jason Bourne come back? Who is paying him? Who is the next to die?</i> But U.S. officials know the shocking truth: There <i>is</i> no Jason Bourne. The name was created as cover for David Webb on his search for the notorious killer Carlos. Someone else has taken the Bourne identity--and unless he is stopped, the world will pay a devastating price. So Jason Bourne must live again. Once again, Webb must utilize his lethal skills--because once again, like a nightmare relived, the woman he loves is suddenly torn from his life. To find her, trap his own impostor, and uncover an explosive secret plan, Webb must lauch a desperate oddyssey into the espionage killing fields. But this time, survival will not be enough. This time Bourne must reign supreme.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Case Files Neurology, Third Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><br><p><strong>The innovative case-based way to learn neurology &#x2013; completely revised for today&#x2019;s shelf exam</strong></p><p>Medical students need exposure to cases to pass the USMLE� and shelf exams, and this is exactly what <em>Case Files:</em> <em>Neurology, Third Edition</em> offers.

This is his debut mystery.The night this all started, I was in a black Irish mood.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that was <i>before</i> I learned my friend was dead.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was sitting at my computer, and I&#x2019;d stumbled across one&nbsp;of those so-called paparazzi videos. It opened with a wide shot&nbsp;of Cape Town&#x2019;s fabled Table Mountain. The camera panned&nbsp;down to the white-capped waves in the harbor. An impossibly&nbsp;long speedboat entered the frame, cutting through the surf like&nbsp;a buttered bullet. A parasailor trailed behind the boat, high&nbsp;in the sky, tethered to the stern by a thin rope. The camera&nbsp;zoomed in on the daredevil&#x2019;s face, and I saw that my old friend&nbsp;Barack Obama was having the time of his life.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unencumbered by his dead-weight loser vice president, 44&nbsp;was on the vacation to end all vacations. Windsurfing on Richard&nbsp;Branson&#x2019;s private island. Kayaking with Justin Trudeau.&nbsp;BASE jumping in Hong Kong with Bradley Cooper. Barack&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t simply tempting the fates&#x2014;he was <i>daring</i> them. And&nbsp;why not? If he could survive eight long years as the first black&nbsp;US president, he could survive anything.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not that I was worried about him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was done getting all worked up over Barack Obama.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I forced myself to look away from the computer. I turned&nbsp;to face the dartboard on the back wall of my office. It was an&nbsp;old Christmas gift from my daughter. I&#x2019;d kept it in storage for&nbsp;many years, but now I finally had some free time on my hands.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe too much free time.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;One call,&#x201d; I said to my faithful companion, Champ. &#x201c;Is&nbsp;that too much to ask?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dog glanced up with indifference. He&#x2019;d heard it all&nbsp;before.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Just one phone call,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a snap of the wrist, I sent the dart sailing across the&nbsp;room. It hit its mark, right between Bradley Cooper&#x2019;s piercing&nbsp;blue eyes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Eight years.&#x201d; I plucked the darts from the shredded magazine&nbsp;cover taped to the board. &#x201c;And not even a gosh-darned&nbsp;postcard.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barack even had the gall to tell <i>People</i> magazine that&nbsp;we still went golfing together on occasion. To save face, I&nbsp;repeated the lie. The truth was, there hadn&#x2019;t been any golf&nbsp;outings. No late-night texting. Not even a friendly poke on&nbsp;Facebook.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched the skies for smoke signals; I read the <i>New</i>&nbsp;<i>York Times</i>, dissecting headlines, looking for clues he might&nbsp;have left me. Nothing. Sometimes late at night, after Jill&nbsp;was sound asleep, I scrolled through the old text messages&nbsp;Barack and I had exchanged a lifetime ago. It was an exercise&nbsp;in futility. If I kept picking at the wound, it was never&nbsp;going to heal.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the darkness outside my office window, I glimpsed a&nbsp;tiny flickering light.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned off my desk lamp to get a better look, and there&nbsp;it was again: a pinprick of orange light, like a firefly . . . or a&nbsp;cigarette.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A prowler? Maybe.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only one way to find out.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, Champ.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dog&#x2019;s ears perked up. I spun the dial on the small&nbsp;closet safe. There were two things inside: my Medal of Freedom. . . and my SIG Sauer pistol. The bean shooter was a gift&nbsp;I&#x2019;d bought for myself, in spite of Jill&#x2019;s objections. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t your&nbsp;shotguns enough?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked. &#x201c;What on earth could you&nbsp;need a handgun for?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For times like this, Jill.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slipped the pistol into the waistband at the small of my&nbsp;back, then tucked my polo shirt over it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I called to my wife, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m letting Champ out.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;answer back. I could hear the TV playing in our bedroom.&nbsp;<i>Law and Order.</i> I should have been watching with her. Instead&nbsp;I opened the back door.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as I did, Champ raced across the lawn and tore&nbsp;off into the woods. The motion light over the back porch&nbsp;should have kicked on, but the bulb was burnt out.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was an old one, I guess.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Old bulbs were meant to burn out.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The moon was full enough to light up the backyard. Our&nbsp;7,000-square-foot lake house sat on four acres of property.&nbsp;Late at night, it was possible to imagine you were all alone&nbsp;in the world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight, however, I wasn&#x2019;t alone.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ahead in the woods was that pinprick of light.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And now I smelled tobacco, a familiar brand.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marlboro Reds.<br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#x2019;t get your hopes up</i>, I told myself. <i>&#x201c;Hope&#x201d; is just a</i>&nbsp;<i>four-letter word.</i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I crossed the yard, walking to the spot where Champ had&nbsp;disappeared into the trees. At the edge of the clearing, I spied&nbsp;a vertically challenged man in a dark gray suit and matching&nbsp;tie. He had short, spiky hair, like he&#x2019;d recently been discharged&nbsp;from the Marines and was letting it grow out. An earpiece wire&nbsp;disappeared into his collar. Secret Service.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart was beating faster than a dog licking a dish.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My own security detail had been dismissed several weeks&nbsp;earlier. Vice presidents were granted six months of protection&nbsp;following their time in office and not a day more unless there&nbsp;were extenuating circumstances.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Nice night for a walk,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secret Service nodded toward the woods, showing me the&nbsp;way. I ducked under a low-hanging branch and kept walking.&nbsp;The heavy foliage overhead diffused the moonlight. I had to&nbsp;tread carefully to avoid the underbrush. The smell of burning&nbsp;tobacco grew stronger. I called for Champ.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In response, I heard flint striking metal. A lighter, close by.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I swiveled around. There. To my left, by the big oak. Ten&nbsp;paces away. A man crouched low, scratching Champ behind&nbsp;the ears. German shepherds don&#x2019;t take to strangers, but this&nbsp;man was no stranger.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He rose to his feet, a slim figure in his black hand-tailored&nbsp;suit. His white dress shirt was unbuttoned at the neck. He took&nbsp;a long drag off his cigarette and exhaled smoke with leisure.&nbsp;Barack Obama was never in a hurry.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears Clean Up</h2><p>An engaging lesson from the iconic Bear family about the importance of working together.</p><p>Stan and Jan Berenstain launched the Berenstain Bears books in 1962 with The Big Honey Hunt.

We all love them, but along with those cute faces and wiggly tails comes a whole host of challenges that make raising a puppy as overwhelming as it is joyful. With so much available but conflicting information out there, it can be very hard for pet parents to know what advice to follow. Where should I get my puppy from? How will I get him to sleep through the night? How long does it take to toilet train my puppy? What is the difference between puppy nipping and biting? How can I successfully introduce a new pup to my kids?<br><br>I answer these questions and many more throughout this book, but I also focus on something that is just as important. I call it the how and the why. Understanding how your puppy experiences the world and why she behaves in a certain way will help you raise her correctly. So while this book is a practical support system and a goto source of information when you are up in the middle of the night wondering how to get your whining puppy to go to sleep or when you are on your knees cleaning up the latest accident, it also helps you understand just how incredible your puppy is. Yes, raising a puppy is challenging, but these challenges are worth it when you hold that bundle of energy in your arms and feel such love that your heart might explode. <i>The Ultimate Guide to Raising a Puppy</i> is with you every step of the way.<br><br>My Story<br><br>I have a passion for dogs and have always been fascinated by their behavior. As a member of an enormous international dog-loving club, I live with and celebrate these incredible animals every day. I am constantly amazed by the fact that dogs are the most successful domestic species on the planet and have successfully evolved with humans over thousands of years. This is an incredible achievement on both sides. Humans have adapted to having dogs in their lives, and we have honed the skills of these effective predators in many different ways. But while we congratulate ourselves for making such a beneficial alliance, we also need to respect the journey made by the dog, which is nothing short of remarkable. Dogs have gone from hunting and fending for themselves to sharing our beds and eating our food. They don&#x2019;t speak our language or understand most of our rules, but they still manage to adapt to our complicated lives. Humans are not easy to live with, but dogs, for the most part, successfully negotiate the challenges we give them.<br><br>I have been a dog trainer and behavior consultant for twenty years, starting out in some of what I still believe are the toughest environments for dogs to live in&#x2014;the cities of London and New York. Relocating to the United States from the UK was a big leap for me in many respects, but the challenges I faced training puppies and adult dogs in a city that only allows dogs off leash in cramped dog runs or in Central Park before 9 a.m. meant that I worked with dogs that not only were incredibly frustrated and reactive, but had developed a whole host of anxieties exacerbated by city living: noise phobias, space issues, separation distress, aggressive behavior toward people and other dogs, touch sensitivities, destructive chewing, and incessant barking, to name but a few.<br><br>But for all its faults, Manhattan can also be the best place to have a dog. The city might be an overwhelming assault on all the senses, but it&#x2019;s a delicious smorgasbord of ever-changing smells&nbsp;that provide countless hours of wonder for nose-driven dogs. Teaching dogs to focus on streets crowded with people, sirens and horns blaring every few minutes, and a myriad of distracting smells from garbage, human waste, and city rats, taught me to be very patient and provided ample opportunity to work with many different and complex canine behavior issues in an unforgiving environment.<br><br>I loved the challenge of working with my canine and human clients in the city, but because of the difficult environment we all lived in, I focused a lot of my time on teaching methods that would prevent behavior problems from occurring in the first place. Techniques designed to instill coping skills and therefore confidence in adults could also be used to great effectiveness with puppies. New Yorkers don&#x2019;t worry about the size of their living spaces, and Great Danes live as comfortably in one-bedroom apartments as pugs and Yorkshire terriers. These dogs benefit from a lot more attention, it seems, than dogs in the suburbs, because at a minimum, their human caregivers have to take them outside to toilet three to four times a day. It was easy for my puppy clients to become housetrained quickly with well-crafted schedules and diligent care. These puppies didn&#x2019;t seem to mind the hustle and bustle of a busy city and enjoyed the constant attention received from inquisitive dogs and passersby. The city itself seemed to offer the perfect stress inoculation, with daily exposure that naturally taught the pups to cope well in social situations. Raising a puppy in New York City was not as difficult as I had first feared.<br><br>In late 2004, I created a TV show called<i> It&#x2019;s Me or the Dog</i> that became very popular around the world and took over my life for eight seasons, filmed over ten years. Because of the success of the show and the subsequent platform it provided, I was able to get the message out about a more humane way of teaching puppies and dogs of all breeds, drives, and with all kinds of behavior problems.<br><br>Then a chance meeting with an experienced K9 handler from the Gwinnett County Sheriff&#x2019;s K9 unit in Georgia led me into the world of police K9. I had already worked with accelerant detection canines, or arson dogs, for the State Farm Arson Dog program but wanted to understand more about the lives of police dogs and their handlers. Having spent a few months attending training seminars and reading all I could about the subject, I started developing a successful web series called <i>Guardians of the Night.</i> The show was initially conceived to explore the state of police dog training in the United States, but it turned into much more. To understand the experience of handlers and their dogs, I had to experience it for myself, and the five years of being immersed in the daily lives of these brave officers and their dogs gave me a new perspective and appreciation for the work they do.<br><br>I still work with police and other working dogs, following their growth from lanky adolescents to courageous adults, and my experience in the working and companion dog world has proven to me that there is no difference in the way a working dog or a pet dog can and should be taught. They both have the same desires, they learn in the same way and have the same need to feel safe and secure. Whatever role your puppy fulfills in your life, never forget that you are a team and the learning is the same. Different jobs obviously require different skills, but most dogs have bionic noses whether we hone their sniffy skills to detect the odor of narcotics or to play scent games at home. Puppy raising follows similar guidelines for all dogs in whatever roles they eventually serve.<br><br>I love working with puppies. These little bundles of energy are blank slates that are eager to lap up and experience anything they can. Their vitality and energy for life fills me with hope and happiness, and I consider it a privilege to help guide pups and their people through the first part of life because early guidance determines a puppy&#x2019;s ultimate success.</p><h2>Harry Potter Set: Adult Edition</h2><p>Harry Potter Boxed Set : The Complete Collection Adult Edition<br>he complete collection of J.K.

But one summer evening, while looking at the stars from a small boat at sea, Lightman was overcome by the overwhelming sensation that he was merging with something larger than himself&#x2014;an eternal unity, something absolute and immaterial. <br><br> The result is an inspired, lyrical meditation from the acclaimed author of <i>Einstein's Dreams</i> that explores these seemingly contradictory impulses. Lightman draws on sources ranging from Saint Augustine's conception of absolute truth to Einstein's theory of relativity, and gives us a profound inquiry into the human desire for truth and meaning, and a journey along the different paths of religion and science that become part of that quest. This small but provocative book explores the tension between our yearning for certainty and permanence versus the modern scientific view that all things in the physical world are uncertain and impermanent.</p><p><b>ALAN LIGHTMAN</b>&#x2014;who worked for many years as a theoretical physicist at Harvard and MIT<br> &#x2014;is the author of six novels, including the international bestseller <i>Einstein's Dreams</i>, as well as <i>The Diagnosis</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award. He is also the author of a memoir, three collections of essays, and several books on science. His work has appeared in <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Granta</i>, <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, Nautilus, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Salon</i>, and <i>Nature</i>, among other publications. He has taught at Harvard and at MIT, where he was the first person to receive a dual faculty appointment in science and the humanities. He is currently professor of the practice of the humanities at MIT. He lives in the Boston area.For many years my wife and I have spent our summers on an island in Maine. It&#x2019;s a small island, only about thirty acres in size, and there are no bridges or ferries connecting it to the mainland. Consequently, each of the six families who live on the island has their own boat. Some of us were not nautical people at first, but over the years we have all learned by necessity. Most challenging are trips to the island at night, when the land masses are only dim shapes in the distance and you must rely on compass headings or faint beacons to avoid crashing into rocks or losing your way. Nevertheless, some of us do attempt the crossing at night.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My story concerns a particular summer night, in the wee hours, when I had just rounded the south end of the island and was carefully motoring toward my dock. No one was out on the water but me. It was a moonless night, and quiet. The only sound I could hear was the soft churning of the engine of my boat. Far from the distracting lights of the mainland, the sky vibrated with stars. Taking a chance, I turned off my running lights, and it got even darker. Then I turned off my engine. I lay down in the boat and looked up. A very dark night sky seen from the ocean is a mystical experience. After a few minutes, my world had dissolved into that star-littered sky. The boat disappeared. My body disappeared. And I found myself falling into infinity. A feeling came over me I&#x2019;d not experienced before. Perhaps a sensation experienced by the ancients at Font-de-Gaume. I felt an overwhelming connection to the stars, as if I were part of them. And the vast expanse of time&#x2014;extending from the far distant past long before I was born and then into the far distant future long after I will die&#x2014;seemed compressed to a dot. I felt connected not only to the stars but to all of nature, and to the entire cosmos. I felt a merging with something far larger than myself, a grand and eternal unity, a hint of something absolute. After a time, I sat up and started the engine again. I had no idea how long I&#x2019;d been lying there looking up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have worked as a physicist for many years, and I have always held a purely scientific view of the world. By that, I mean that the universe is made of material and nothing more, that the universe is governed exclusively by a small number of fundamental forces and laws, and that all composite things in the world, including humans and stars, eventually disintegrate and return to their component parts. Even at the age of twelve or thirteen, I was impressed by the logic and materiality of the world. I built my own laboratory and stocked it with test tubes and petri dishes, Bunsen burners, resistors and capacitors, coils of electrical wire. Among other projects, I began making pendulums by tying a fishing weight to the end of a string. I&#x2019;d read in <i>Popular Science</i> or some similar magazine that the time for a pendulum to make a complete swing was proportional to the square root of the length of the string. With the help of a stopwatch and ruler, I verified this wonderful law. Logic and pattern. Cause and effect. As far as I could tell, everything was subject to numerical analysis and quantitative test. I saw no reason to believe in God, or in any other unprovable hypotheses.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet after my experience in that boat many years later, I understood what Lord Indra of the Vedas must have felt when he first drank soma and could see the light of the gods. I understood the powerful allure of the Absolutes&#x2014;ethereal things that are all-encompassing, unchangeable, eternal, sacred. At the same time, and perhaps paradoxically, I remained a scientist. I remained committed to the material world.<br><br>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; <br><br>Belief in various Absolutes is alive and well in the world today. A new survey of 35,000 adults by the Pew Research Center found that 89 percent of Americans believe in God, and 74 percent believe in life after death&#x2014;that is, in some form of immortality. A somewhat older survey by the Barna Group, an organization devoted to religion and culture, found that 50 percent of Christians in America believe in some form of absolute truth, while 25 percent of non-Christians do so. Buddhists worldwide believe in the Four Noble Truths. Hindus worship Brahman, the embodiment of eternal and absolute truth. Belief in certain physical manifestations of the Absolutes is also alive and well. A 2014 Gallup survey found that 42 percent of Americans believe in the constancy of species&#x2014;in particular, that humans were created in their present form in the first days of the planet.<br><br>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; <br><br>In the last couple of centuries and especially in recent decades, many of the Absolutes have been challenged by discoveries in science. Nothing in the physical world seems to be constant or permanent. Stars burn out. Atoms disintegrate. Species evolve. Motion is relative. Even other universes might exist, many without life. Unity has given way to multiplicity. I say that the Absolutes have been challenged rather than disproved, because the notions of the Absolutes cannot be disproved any more than they can be proved. The Absolutes are ideals, entities, beliefs in things that lie beyond the physical world. Some may be true and some false, but the truth or falsity cannot be proven.<br>&nbsp;<br>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br><br>In recent years, I&#x2019;ve gotten to know a prominent Buddhist monk in Cambodia by the name of Yos Hut Khemacaro. His friends call him Khema. He was born in 1948 in a little farming village in the province of Prey Veng and went to a primary school there administered by monks. At the age of ten, as he now vividly recalls, he was &#x201c;attracted to learn wisdom&#x201d; and began studying Buddhism. Eventually he was ordained a monk himself. In 1973, Khema started working with the United Nations on human rights, in Australia and Thailand. After the devastation of the Khmer Rouge genocide in the mid to late 1970s, during which monks were targeted along with all educated people, Khema returned to Cambodia and played a major role in rebuilding the Buddhist monkhood there.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I visited Khema one warm day in January at Wat Lanka, his monastery on a busy avenue in Phnom Penh. I was hoping that he might help me fathom my communion with the stars that summer night in Maine and other experiences I&#x2019;d not understood. Buddhism embodies an interesting mix of beliefs. The Four Noble Truths would appear to reside within the realm of the Absolutes, while the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence is a Relative.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wat Lanka is a large temple complex containing several pagodas, patios and walkways, and living quarters for some two hundred monks. The magnificent front gate rises forty feet high and is guarded by stone lions on both sides. As soon as you step through that arched edifice, you leave behind the steady drone of motors and the shouting of street sellers&#x2014;and enter a realm of serenity. Slowly, I walked past the gold-leaf pagodas. I passed obelisk-like stone stupas and scattered stone pots filled with red and pink bougainvillea. I passed through courtyards with young men in orange robes quietly strolling in pairs. Eventually, I came to Khema&#x2019;s living quarters, a tiny house at the back end of the complex. We sat under some trees. A faint scent of jasmine wafted through the air.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under the trees, Khema and I began discussing modern physics and cosmology. I had brought him one of my own books on the subject. &#x201c;Buddhism is in complete agreement with science,&#x201d; Khema said slowly and smiled. Then he added, &#x201c;Science puts in more details.&#x201d; Khema explained the Buddhist belief that the universe has gone through an infinite number of cycles in the past and will go through an infinite number of cycles in the future. When I mentioned to him that modern cosmologists have evidence that the universe will continue expanding without further cycles, he laughed. Perhaps he thought it was preposterous that science could know such a thing. Or perhaps he thought it delightful that science could know such a thing. While we were talking, Khema&#x2019;s sister, an ancient nun with a shaved head, appeared from somewhere and silently served us tea. I noticed that her hands were wrinkled and worn, like the cracked yellow paint on the walls of Khema&#x2019;s house.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I asked Khema how Buddhists know that the universe has already gone through an infinite number of cycles. He said that knowledge comes from the Buddha, one of whose names is<i> lokavid&#x16b;,</i> the &#x201c;knower of worlds.&#x201d; &#x201c;The Buddha knew everything,&#x201d; said Khema. He took out a pen and scribbled down some books I should read. His writing was slow and deliberate, like himself. We stopped talking. In the distance, I could hear the rise and fall of monks&#x2019; chanting, soft like the sound of the wind, unintelligible. I had no idea what time it was .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During my visit with Khema, he mentioned the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism: First, that life is filled with suffering. Second, that the origin of suffering is the craving and clinging to impermanent things. Third, that the suffering of life can be ended. And fourth, that the path to that end is through meditation, self-discipline, and mindful living. Although the Buddha first articulated the Four Noble Truths 2,500 years ago, Khema was careful to make clear that we come to these truths through our own experience with the world. But on other matters, such as their belief in the infinite cycles of the universe, Buddhists base their convictions exclusively on the words of the Buddha, a human being born as Siddh&#x101;rtha Gautama, later known as the<i> lokavid&#x16b;,</i> the &#x201c;knower of worlds.&#x201d; I thought to myself: How do we know that the Buddha was the knower of worlds? Were Einstein and Darwin also knowers of worlds? The truths and laws that we believe about the physical and spiritual worlds&#x2014;why do we believe them? And on what authority?<br>&nbsp;<br>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br><br>There are major differences in the truths of science and religion and the manner in which those truths are discovered. Unlike religion, science does not accept truths and laws based on the authority of divine beings or their designated emissaries or even from the institution of science as a whole. The ideas of great figures in science, such as Niels Bohr and Alexander von Humboldt and Claude Bernard, might be taken seriously for a time simply out of deference to those towering intellects, but eventually the ideas will be accepted or rejected based on experimental test. Similarly, the personal transcendent experience, while a vital source of truth in religion, is viewed with suspicion in science. Personal passion may be a motivation and pleasure for scientists in doing their work, but the only truths and results that are accepted by the scientific community are those that can be reproduced in different experiments by different scientists and rederived by different people from the same mathematical equations. Indeed, science goes out of its way to try to eliminate the personal from the process of acquiring knowledge.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, we see strong differences between science and religion in the process of <i>revision.</i> The core beliefs of religion&#x2014;and indeed the ideals of any of the Absolutes&#x2014;are not subject to change or revision. The wisdom of God or of the enlightened Buddha is absolute. It is perfect. So is the nature of permanence, of unity, of indivisibility, of absolute truth. These entities of the Absolute are not approximations, like Newton&#x2019;s equations for gravity. They are exact. They are like perfect circles, eternal and unassailable. They are like the <i>amrita, </i>the elixir of immortality. They are like Plato&#x2019;s ideal forms.<br><br>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br><br>One summer, we had two or three hummingbirds darting about the feeder we hung on the veranda at the south end of our house. I quietly watched them from a back window, afraid of scaring them off. The birds seem to defy gravity. They hover. They float. They are &#x201c;air within the air,&#x201d; said Pablo Neruda. They are a painter&#x2019;s accents, splashes of color on the canvas of the world, with iridescent blue heads and ruby red throats, iridescent light green and saffron bodies, orangish tails. You can&#x2019;t see the color of their wings because they are flapping back and forth 50 times per second. To supply oxygen for such an engine, the highest metabolism of almost all animals, the heart rate of a hummingbird is an incredible 1,300 beats per minute. Oxygen consumption per weight is ten times that of top human athletes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can actually calculate a lot of the design specs of the hummingbird from basic physics and biology. The hummingbird earns its living by being able to hover in midair while sucking the nectar from delicious flowers. How fast must it flap its wings to perform such an acrobatic feat? Slow-motion videos of hummingbirds show that their wings move in a rotary motion, changing shape and angle throughout each cycle. If you require that the bird achieve the require aerodynamic lift to support its weight, its wing tip must move at about 1,500 centimeters per second. That corresponds to a flapping rate of about 50 flaps per second, as observed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can also compute the required heart rate. A human being can flap its wings, i.e., arms, at about 4 times per second. (I have personally verified this result in front of my appalled students at MIT.) Since the heart rate of an exercising human is around 125 beats per minute, the required heart rate of an h-bird, needing 50 flaps per second, should be 50/4 times larger, or about 1,600 beats per minute. That number is pretty close to the figure observed. It&#x2019;s all a matter of science, like the swing of a pendulum. It&#x2019;s all material. But when I&#x2019;m looking at the birds, suspended in space, I don&#x2019;t think numbers or gravity. I just watch and am amazed.</p><h2>Accounting For Dummies (For Dummies (Business &amp; Personal Finance))</h2><p><b>Open the books on accounting with this friendly guide</b> <p>Want to make sense of accounting basics but don't know where to begin?

Top scholars--like the late John Boswell of Yale, Daniel Boyarin of Berkeley, Bernadette Brooten of Brandeis, L.William Countryman of the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Victor P. Furnish of SMU, Saul M. Olyan of Brown and Robin Scruggs of Union Theological Seminary--show that those who perceive Bible passages as condemning homosexuality are being misled by faulty translation and poor interpretation...... Danial A. Helminiak, Ph.D. respected theologian and Roman Catholic priest, explains in a clear fashion the fascinating new insights of these scholars...... The Bible has been used to justify slavery, inquisitions, apartheid and the subjugation of women. Now, in this books which has sold over 100 thousand copies, read what the Bible really says about homosexuality.</p><p>Believing that the translation of the Bible they use consists of the inerrant word of God, some Christians cite a handful of passages to justify their condemnation of homosexuality. But historical biblical scholarship holds that these believers' conception of inerrancy is naively based, for English versions of the originally Hebrew and Greek scriptures are rife with problematic translations. Some scholars further maintain that the supposedly antihomosexual passages are not blanket condemnations of homosexual persons and acts. Indeed, in some cases, these verses aren't about homosexuality at all; they meant quite different things to those for whom they were first written, peoples whose social conceptions of sexuality were vastly different from ours. Helminiak provides cogent, accessible precis of these revisionist findings on the Bible's six major passages and few minor references that seem to denounce homosexuality. The Bible does not condemn gay sex as we understand it today, he concludes; those who seek to know outright if gay or lesbian sex is good or evil . . . will have to look elsewhere for an answer. An extremely valuable contribution to popular gay and biblical studies. <i>Ray Olson</i>Helminiak, a Roman Catholic priest, has done careful reading in current biblical scholarship about homosexuality. While cautioning against viewing biblical teaching as "the last word on sexual ethics," he stresses the need for accurate understanding of what the biblical "facts" are and concludes that "the Bible supplies no real basis for the condemnation of homosexuality." Using the studies of Yale historian John Boswell (Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe, LJ 7/94), New Testament seminary professor L. William Countryman, and others, Helminiak examines the story of Sodom (where the sin was inhospitality), Jude's decrying sex with angels, and five texts-Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, Romans 1:27, I Corinthians 6:9, and I Timothy 1:10-all of which, he concludes, "are concerned with something other than homogenital activity itself."

Along the way, Ted details his late &#x2019;60s stint as an unlikely star with the sunshine pop outfit Harpers Bizarre and his grind-it-out days as a Warner Bros. tape listener, including the life-altering moment that launched his career as a producer: his discovery of the Doobie Brothers.</p> <p>Ted Templeman: A Platinum Producer&#x2019;s Life in Music takes us into the studio sessions of No. 1 hits like &#x201c;Black Water&#x201d; by the Doobie Brothers and &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; by Van Halen, as Ted recounts memories and the behind-the-scene dramas that engulfed both massively successful acts. Throughout, Ted also reveals the inner workings of his professional and personal relationships with some of the most talented and successful recording artists in history, including Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Eric Clapton, Lowell George, Sammy Hagar, Linda Ronstadt, David Lee Roth, and Carly Simon.</p></p><p><b>Greg Renoff </b>was born in the Bronx, grew up in New Jersey, and now lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is the author of Van Halen Rising: How a Southern California Backyard Party Band Saved Heavy Metal. His writing has appeared in Guitar World, LA Weekly, and Vulture, and he and his work have been profiled in Salon, Maxim, and the Boston Herald.<p>What gave me pause about &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; was my instinctive sense of what defined the Van Halen <i>sound</i>. When I produce an artist, I get a feel for what will likely work -- and not work -- on an album, especially when you&#x2019;ve done five with them.</p><br> <p>To me, Van Halen wasn&#x2019;t a pop group. Yes, they&#x2019;d done &#x201c;Dance the Night Away&#x201d; and &#x201c;Pretty Woman,&#x201d; but that was as far afield from their raucous, primitive nature that I wanted them to go. &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; was <i>way</i> too pop to my ears. I wanted them to stay edgy and raw.</p><br> <p>As I tried to explain to Ed and the guys, it wasn&#x2019;t that I was &#x201c;anti-keyboards.&#x201d; Remember, I was completely fucking knocked out when Ed played me the piano riff for &#x201c;Cradle&#x201d; at Sunset Sound. Ed had played keyboards on &#x201c;Dancing in the Street.&#x201d; I know it sounds like an odd comparison, but the &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; riff didn&#x2019;t sound like Ed&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t Talkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout Love&#x201d; riff. That&#x2019;s the stomping, powerful sound that I thought they should have kept pursuing. Even though <i>Diver Down</i> served its purposes, it was too pop for me. I liked the <i>Fair Warning</i> stuff better. I thought these guys should stay right in that pocket, and not go pop. To me, Van Halen doing &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; seemed analogous to Keith Richards pushing for the Stones to record something sappy like &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&#x201d; by Herman&#x2019;s Hermits right after they&#x2019;d done &#x201c;Brown Sugar.&#x201d;</p><br> <p>The other point I tried to get across that day was about Ed&#x2019;s guitar playing. I think Ed recalls this debate as Dave and I wanting to keep him locked into &#x201c;guitar hero&#x201d; mode for the sake of his image. I can&#x2019;t speak for Dave, but that wasn&#x2019;t where I was coming from. His image had nothing to do with my view. Here&#x2019;s the thing. Ed&#x2019;s a guitar genius. No one has ever played or ever will play the way that he did on electric guitar. You immediately knew it was him playing something, and he had profound things to say on the instrument. Guys tried to copy him, and none of them came close. He was like Charlie Parker or Errol Garner. Ed&#x2019;s right in there with jazz guys like that; they are generational talents. But, to me, any competent keyboardist could have <i>played</i> that keyboard riff. You can&#x2019;t say the same about anything he <i>plays</i> on guitar.</p><br> <p>But Ed, to his credit, told me I was wrong about &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; not working for Van Halen. He said, &#x201c;Ted, I&#x2019;ve been listening to a lot of classical music and playing keyboards and this is what I came up with. I really like it.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t say it, but I also knew that Donn had been encouraging him to stretch out musically, to follow his muse, and write on keyboards.</p><br> <p>I could see Ed had a big personal investment in the song, and had worked hard on it. So I said, &#x201c;Okay, fine. It&#x2019;s a start. That doesn&#x2019;t really float my boat, but let&#x2019;s see where we can go with it.&#x201d; Again, this was Ed&#x2019;s taste versus mine. He wanted to work on it, so I was game. What I didn&#x2019;t say was: <i>Let&#x2019;s not do the song</i>.</p><br> <p>I left, went home, and went to bed. Then around three in the morning, the phone rang. I let it go to the answering machine, but the volume on it was up, so I could hear the message after the beep.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Hey Ted!&#x201d;</p><br> <p>Ed and Al.</p><br> <p>&#x201c;Wake up! We&#x2019;re still here. We&#x2019;ve got something great for you to hear.&#x201d;</p><br> <p>They held the phone up. I could hear &#x201c;Jump&#x201d; playing.</p><br> <p>They sounded jazzed, so I called right back. Ed said he&#x2019;d come and get me at my place in Century City.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>If I'm not mistaken, Ed did in fact pick me up and took me up there to hear it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br> <p>It turned out that Dave and Mike had gone home too, but Ed, Alex, and Donn had stayed up all night. They&#x2019;d recorded basic tracks for three songs from <i>1984</i>: &#x201c;Jump,&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll Wait,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Drop Dead Legs.&#x201d;</p><br> <p>Donn rolled tape on the newest version of &#x201c;Jump.&#x201d; He played it a few times. As I listened, it really put the hooks into me. He and Al had the riff and groove nailed down tight. It killed me. The keyboard parts Ed had down -- it wasn&#x2019;t a complete song yet -- were very close to what ended up on <i>1984</i>.</p></p><h2>Trouble with Trolls</h2><p>Treva&#39;s trouble with trolls begins when she climbs Mount Baldy with her dog Tuffi. The trolls who live there long for a dog, and they try to kidnap him. But Treva is brave and quick-thinking. She outwits one troll after another until she reaches the very top of the mountain, where five trolls are waiting--and they want her dog! From underground to mountain peak, Jan Brett&#39;s story is filled with adventure and eye-catching detail.</p><p>With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books. Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.<p>As a child, Jan Brett decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, "I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real."</p><p>As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. "It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain," she says. "I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting."</p><p>Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. "From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books."</p>PreSchool-Grade 3-- Treva's trouble begins when she and her dog, Tuffi, go up Mount Baldy. She meets five white-haired trolls, all intent on taking Tuffi; they want a dog and have filled their underground burrow with the things such a pet would need. Quick-thinking Treva, using tactics worthy of Br'er Rabbit, convinces the trolls that her mittens, hat, sweater, etc., are much more important to her than a dog, but wins all her belongings back before she and Tuffi escape down the mountain. Obviously influenced by Scandinavian folklore, the story is appealing. With the fine details that have become her trademark, Brett tells two stories at the same time: the child's encounters with the trolls appear on the top three-fourths of each spread, and a cross-section of their abode occupies the bottom. A humorous subplot involves a curious hedgehog. Set against a wintery, snow-capped background, the saturated colors seem to jump off the page. As always, Brett does a remarkably realistic job of depicting clothing and the natural landscape. Less successful, however, are her renderings of Treva and Tuffi, who have a slightly frozen quality. But the trolls are a personable bunch and readers may hate to see them disappear at the end. Overall, a visually attractive and accessible book that's ideal for individual use, but also fun to share aloud. --Denise Anton Wright, Illinois State Univ . , Normal<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Disorder in the Court: Great Fractured Moments in Courtroom History</h2><p><p><strong>In America's courtooms, the verdict is laughter.</strong></p><p>Sit back and enjoy a collection of verbatim exchanges from the halls of justice, where defendants and plaintiffs, lawyers and witnesses, juries and judges, collide to produce memorably insane comedy.</p><p>A: You mumbled on the first part of that and I couldn't understand what you were saying.

It is likewise possible to stop a common cold from developing in less than a minute. Facial reflexology, one of the simplest and most effective healthcare methods, provides rapid relief for many of these common ailments. Developed in 1980 by Vietnamese doctors in Ho Chi Minh City as a less invasive alternative to facial acupuncture, facial reflexology uses healing principles based on the I Ching and Buddhist teachings. The therapy is simple enough that it can be self-administered by a beginner with immediate results and is also a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.<br><br>In <i>Facial Reflexology </i>Marie-France Muller introduces this healing practice to the English-speaking world for the first time. She describes the mechanics of facial reflexology--facial diagnosis, facial pressure points, reflex zones, massage and pressure techniques--and provides healing routines both for treating acute ailments and maintaining overall good health. Included is an extensive dictionary of more than 200 common ailments, accompanied by therapeutic instructions and easy-to-follow diagrams of the points to be stimulated, for complaints such as indigestion, asthma, pinched nerves, fatigue, insomnia, menstrual cramps, migraines, high blood pressure, sprains, pulled muscles, and even the common cold.</p><p>Marie-France Muller, M.D., N.D., has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and has worked as a naturopathic doctor for more than 25 years.

The system was originally developed in the 1980s by doctors in Ho Chi Minh City as a less invasive alternative to facial acupuncture. Made accessible to the West by Nhuan Le Quang, an &#x9b69;gr&#x9834;o France, Vietnamese facial reflexology--or Dien&#x2019; Cham&#x2019;--promotes a healthy flow of energy throughout the body by stimulation of 57 acupressure points and associated &#x201c;reflex zones&#x201d; on the face. As with other reflexology systems, such as foot or hand reflexology, it is possible to visualize a projection of the entire human body superimposed over the face. One can then stimulate an organ or body part by massaging the corresponding facial reflex zone. <br><br>In <em>Facial Reflexology</em> Marie-France Muller introduces this Vietnamese healing practice to the English-speaking world for the first time. She presents 13 basic summary diagrams that locate all 57 numbered facial points and clearly delineates their corresponding reflex zones for the entire body. These diagrams are accompanied by easy-to follow instructions on basic massage and pressure-point techniques. <br><br>The author gives point-by-point instructions for two general health-maintenance routines and offers a dictionary of therapeutic sessions for more than 200 common ailments such as asthma, back pain, bronchitis, digestive problems, high blood pressure, insomnia, menstrual difficulties, and ulcers. Therapeutic instructions and simple diagrams of the relevant points and zones are included for every condition. <br><br>A chapter on advanced Dien&#x2019; Cham&#x2019; teaches readers how to select points for personalized health-maintenance routines and a final chapter on Dien&#x2019; Cham&#x2019; for animals applies the principles of facial reflexology to dogs, cats, and even horses. Appendices on Chinese facial massage and Japanese scalp massage will provide useful points of reference for practitioners more familiar with these other acupressure systems.

Some "answers" they receive appeal to mystery: &#x201c;God&#x2019;s ways are not our ways&#x201d;. Some answers say God allows evil for a greater purpose. Some say evil is God's punishment.<br><br>The usual answers fail. They don't support the truth God loves everyone all the time. <b>God Can't</b> gives a believable answer to why a good and powerful God doesn't prevent evil.<br><br>Author <b>Thomas Jay Oord</b> says God&#x2019;s love is inherently uncontrolling. God loves everyone and everything, so God can't control anyone or anything. This means God cannot prevent evil singlehandedly. God can&#x2019;t stop evildoers, whether human, animal, organisms, or inanimate objects and forces.<br><br>In <b>God Can't</b>, Oord gives a plausible reason why some are healed but many others are not. God always works to heal everyone, but sometimes our bodies, organisms, or other creatures do not cooperate with God's healing work. Or the conditions of creation are not right for the healing God wants to do. <br> <br>Some people think God causes or allows suffering to teach us lessons or build our character. <b>God Can't</b> disagrees. Oord says God squeezes good from the evil God didn&#x2019;t want in the first place. God uses pain and suffering without willing or even allowing it.<br><br>Most people think God can overcome evil singlehandedly. In <b>God Can't</b>, Oord says God needs cooperation for love to reign now and later. This leads to a better view of the afterlife he calls, &#x201c;relentless love.&#x201d; It rejects traditional ideas of heaven, hell, and annihilation. Relentless love holds to the possibility all creatures and all creation will respond to God&#x2019;s love.<br><br><b>God Can't</b> is written in understandable language. <b>Thomas Jay Oord's</b> status as a world-renown theologian brings credibility to the book&#x2019;s radical ideas. He explains these ideas through true stories, illustrations, and scripture. <br> <br><b>God Can't</b> is for those who want answers to tragedy, abuse, and other evils that make sense!<br><br>What They're Saying...<br><br>&#x201c;If conventional notions of God make less and less sense to you, you&#x2019;ll find Thomas Jay Oord&#x2019;s new book a breath of fresh air. Simply put, &#x201c;God Can&#x2019;t&#x201d; presents an understanding of God that thoughtful, ethical people can believe in.&#x201d;<br>-- Brian D. McLaren, author of The Great Spiritual Migration<br><br>"I did not want this book to end. I wish Dr. Oord had written it 100 years ago, or 1000 years ago... To find your understanding of life and your love for God renewed, read this book."<br>-- Dr. Karen Strand Winslow, Ph.D., Biblical and Jewish Studies Professor of Bible, Azusa Pacific University<br><br>&#x201c;As a clinical psychologist working with people in trauma, I owe Thomas Jay Oord an enormous debt of gratitude for recasting the so-called problem of evil in terms that are conceptually satisfying, theologically consistent, and pastorally liberating.&#x201d;<br>-- Dr Roger Bretherton- Principal Lecturer at the University of Lincoln (UK), Chair of the British Association of Christians in Psychology<br><br>&#x201c;Victims of trauma sometimes hear theological responses that imply their suffering is somehow &#x201c;God&#x2019;s will." A more careful theological reflection on the nature of the power of a God who is love can help. Oord gives us a clear and compelling alternative in this profoundly insightful and admirably concrete and accessible book.&#x201d;<br>-- Dr. Anna Case-Winters, Professor of Theology at McCormick Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;I know of no book that speaks to suffering with the depth of theological sophistication and psychological sensitivity as God Can&#x2019;t. This book is a rare combination of depth and accessibility, truly written for the wounded. I recommend it to my students, parishioners, and therapy clients.&#x201d;<br>-- Dr. Brad D.

One of those interests is the human pursuit of truth, which has strengthened slowly over the generations (for there was not always science). I wish to strengthen that pursuit further, in this generation. That is a wish of mine, for the Future. For we are all of us players upon that vast gameboard, whether we accept the responsibility or not.&#x201c;And that makes your rationality my business.&#x201c;Is this a dangerous idea? Yes, and not just pleasantly edgy &#x201c;dangerous.&#x201d; People have been burned to death because some priest decided that they didn&#x2019;t think the way they should. Deciding to burn people to death because they &#x2018;don&#x2019;t think properly&#x2019;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a revolting kind of reasoning, isn&#x2019;t it? You wouldn&#x2019;t want people to think that way, why, it&#x2019;s disgusting. People who think like that, well, we&#x2019;ll have to do something about them...&#x201c;I agree! Here&#x2019;s my proposal: Let&#x2019;s argue against bad ideas but not set their bearers on fire.&#x201d;Human intelligence is a superweapon: an amazing capacity that has single-handedly put humans in a dominant position on Earth. When human intelligence defeats itself and goes off the rails, the fallout therefore tends to be a uniquely big deal. In How to Actually Change Your Mind, decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky asks how we can better identify and sort out our biases, integrate new evidence, and achieve lucidity in our daily lives. Because it really seems as though we should be able to do better&#x2014;&#x2014;and a three-pound all-purpose superweapon is a terrible thing to waste.</p><p></p><h2>Crunch the Shy Dinosaur</h2><p><b>From Cirocco Dunlap (<i>This Book Will Not Be Fun</i>) and Theodor Seuss Geisel Award winner Greg Pizzoli (<i>The Watermelon Seed</i>) comes a charming, giggly read-aloud that illustrates the particular art of making a friend!</b><br><br>Crunch is a lovely and quiet brontosaurus who has hidden himself in some shubbery and is rather shy.

After seventy-five years of peace in the Pacific, a new challenger to American power has emerged, on a scale not seen in generations. Working from a deep sense of national destiny, the Chinese Communist Party is guiding a country of 1.4 billion people towards what it calls "the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," and, with it, the end of an American-led world. Will this generation witness the final act for America as a superpower? Can American ingenuity, confidence, and will power outcompete the long-term strategic thinking and planning of China's Communist Party? These are the challenges that will shape the next decade and more. China's Vision of Victory brings the reader to a new understanding of China's planning, strategy, and ambitions. From seabed to space, from Africa to the Arctic, from subsurface warfare to the rise of China's global corporations, this book will illuminate for the reader the new great game of our lifetimes, and how our adversary sees it all.</p></p><p>DR. JONATHAN D. T. WARD has been studying the rise of China for over a decade. From travels with truck caravans in Tibet and across the South China Sea by cargo ship in his early twenties, to accessing Communist Party archives that have now been closed to the world while a PhD candidate at Oxford, to consulting for the US Department of Defense and Fortune 500 organizations, he has brought experience of a traveler, the discipline of a scholar, and the insight of a strategy consultant to one of the toughest, biggest pictures of our time: what does China want, how will it try to get it, and what should America do? Dr. Ward is Founder of Atlas Organization, a consultancy focused on the rise of India and China, and on US-China global competition. He speaks Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Arabic."The extraordinary rise of China is unprecedented in world history and the biggest geopolitical development of the first two decades of the 21st Century; it is likely to continue to be so for decades to come.

Uniquely set within the larger sweep of history and filled with rich profiles of outsize figures, fresh iconoclastic scholarship, and a gripping narrative, this is a masterful account of the thirty most pivotal days in the life of the United States. </p></p><p>There are a few books that belong on the shelf of every Civil War buff: James M. McPherson's <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i>, one of the better Abraham Lincoln biographies, something on Robert E. Lee, perhaps Shelby Foote's massive trilogy <i>The Civil War</i>. Add Jay Winik's wonderful <i>April 1865</i> to the list. This is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an old subject and changes the way we think about it. Winik shows that there was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. It all happened so quickly, in what "proved to be perhaps the most moving and decisive month not simply of the Civil War, but indeed, quite likely, in the life of the United States." <p> Things might have been rather different, too. "What emerges from the panorama of April 1865 is that the whole of our national history could have been altered but for a few decisions, a quirk of fate, a sudden shift in luck." When Lee abandoned Richmond, for instance, his soldiers rendezvoused at a nearby town called Amelia Court House. There, the general expected to find boxcars full of food for his hungry troops. But "a mere administrative mix-up" left his army empty-handed and may have limited Lee's options in the days to come. Or what if Lee had decided not to surrender at all, but to turn his resourceful army into an outfit of guerrilla fighters who would harass federal officials? National reconciliation might have become impossible as the whole South turned into a region plagued with violence and terrorism. For the Union, "there would be no real rest, no real respite, no true amity, nor, for that matter, any real sense of victory--only an amorphous state of neither war nor peace, raging like a low-level fever." One of Lee's officers actually proposed this scenario to his commander in those final hours; America is fortunate Lee didn't choose this path. </p><p> Winik is an exceptionally good storyteller. <i>April 1865</i> is full of memorable images and you-are-there writing. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought. Let it be said plainly: <i>April 1865</i> is a magnificent work, surely the best book on the Civil War to be published in some time. <i>--John J.

Shane tackles many of the mundane and quirky questions that he&#x2019;s often asked about living with a disability, and shows readers that he&#x2019;s just as approachable, friendly, and funny as anyone else.</b></p><p>Shane Burcaw was born with a rare disease called spinal muscular atrophy, which hinders his muscles&#x2019; growth. As a result, his body hasn&#x2019;t grown bigger and stronger as he&#x2019;s gotten older&#x2015;it&#x2019;s gotten smaller and weaker instead. This hasn&#x2019;t stopped him from doing the things he enjoys (like eating pizza and playing sports and video games) with the people he loves, but it does mean that he routinely relies on his friends and family for help with everything from brushing his teeth to rolling over in bed.</p><p><b>A Chicago Public Library Best Book of 2017</b></p></p><p><p><b>Shane Burcaw</b> is a twenty-three-year-old with spinal muscular atrophy. He lives in Bethlehem, PA with his family, and runs a blog and eponymous nonprofit organization dedicated to raising money for muscular dystrophy research. </p><p><b>Matt Carr</b> is an award-winning visual storyteller with a background in photojournalism and a penchant for delivering honest, believable, and beautifully lit scenes. His photography has been published in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> among other publications, and he has been recognized by <i>American Photo</i>, <i>Hasselblad Masters</i>, <i>PDN</i>, <i>IPA</i>, and <i>Communication Arts</i>. After 10 years working in London and Prague, Matt now lives in Brooklyn with his wife and their spirited 4-year-old daughter.</p>Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Burcaw answers the most common questions he gets about having a disability. He was born with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which makes his muscles grow weaker throughout his life and his body smaller as he ages. A range of questions, from "What's wrong with you?" to "How do you play with your friends," are answered in a concise yet thorough way. Burcaw takes a humorous approach towards each topic, such as comparing himself to a T. rex when discussing why his head is bigger than the rest of his body. Additionally, he describes his wheelchair as working with a joystick "sort of like a video-game controller." This ultimately serves to emphasize that though Burcaw may look different, he is a person whom kids can empathize with. The discussion of his family's help and how it feels to be made fun of will allow readers to more fully understand what it is like to live with a disability. The pages are visually pleasing, with brightly colored photographs of Burcaw accompanying bold graphics and speech bubbles. An author's note at the end goes into greater detail about SMA and Burcaw's work as a disability rights activist. VERDICT This slim book packs a punch and can serve as a good introduction for students about people with disabilities.&#x2014;Kathryn Justus, Renbrook School, West Hartford, CT</p><h2>The Backstagers Vol. 1 (1)</h2><p>All the world's a stage . . . but what happens behind the curtain is pure magic&#x2014;literally!<br><br>When Jory transfers to an all-boys private high school, he&#x2019;s taken in by the only ones who don&#x2019;t treat him like a new kid, the lowly stage crew known as the Backstagers.

As a teenager he worked as an errand boy, inker, and animator at several pioneering animation<br>studios in New York. By 1933 he had moved to Hollywood, where he wrote and directed cartoon shorts for MGM and Warner Bros., and briefly served as head of production at Screen Gems. Tashlin also worked for a while at Disney Studios, helping to organize its embattled animators&#x2019; union. During his early years in California, Tashlin drew a syndicated<br>pantomime-style cartoon strip called Van Boring, and during the Second World War, he worked on the military&#x2019;s Private Snafu series (created by Frank Capra and Theodor &#x201c;Dr. Seuss&#x201d; Geisel). Though he retired from animation in the mid-1940s, Tashlin is recognized as an influential stylist who brought cinematographic techniques and inventive &#x201c;camera&#x201d; angles to the medium. Moving from cartoons to live action, Tashlin worked for a time as a comedy writer before fulfilling his ambition to write and direct feature films. He is best known for his collaborations with Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope, and for screwball comedies like <i>The Girl Can&#x2019;t Help It</i> and <i>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter</i>? Tashlin has described <i>The Bear That Wasn&#x2019;</i>t (1946) as &#x201c;precious and special to me.&#x201d; It was followed by two more picture books, <i>The &#x2018;Possum That Didn&#x2019;t</i> (1950) and <i>The World That Wasn&#x2019;t</i> (1951).&#x201c;Like a good many modern satirical fables about animals, this falls heavily between the stools of adult and juvenile interest.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i> The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;It is a fable for grownups that will be fun for children.

"If you are not acquainted with <i>The Gospel in Brief</i>," wrote the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose life was profoundly influenced by it, "then you cannot imagine what an effect it can have upon a person." <p></p></p><p><p>Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) is the author of <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>Anna Karenina</em>, <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em>, <em>Family Happiness</em>, and other classics of Russian literature.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Romans 1-7: The gift of God: 7 studies for individuals or groups (Bible studies for small groups which explore the gospel) (Good Book Guides)</h2><p>We want to be right in the eyes of the law of our land, of those we respect, of our loved ones, of those we work with. We strive to gain and then keep this right standing. <br> But there is another, far better and more important righteousness. A righteousness which changes and liberates every aspect of our lives, and yet which none of us can earn or maintain ourselves. <br> It s a righteousness from God. <br> Romans 1 7 is all about that righteousness. It shows us why we don t have it, why we need it, and how we can receive it. It thrills us that the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6 v 23). <br> These seven studies will help you to understand one of the most-read, most written-about parts of the Bible. And, as they enable you to you unwrap God s precious gift of right standing with him, they ll transform your hearts, lives, identities and perspectives. <br> For use with individuals or groups. <br> Leader s Guide included.</p><p><b>Timothy Keller</b> was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and educated at Bucknell University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and Westminster Theological Seminary.

How can we get by without computers, power tools, phones, or even basics such as electric lights and appliances? The answers lie in Amish communities and other Old Order groups in the United States, Canada, and Mexico that have been living lives off the grid while still affording to be self-sufficient for countless years.<br><br><i>Living Without Electricity</i> examines the Amish response to technology and shows us why and how they live without inventions other people take for granted. Taking lessons from the Amish, learn how to light a room without electricity, keep warm without centralized heating, get around without a car, communicate without a phone, and others. In addition, take Amish instruction on how to cook and store food, pump water, wash clothes, and even run farms and businesses, all while off the electric grid. Reconsider the basic necessities of your life, and you might decide to orientate yourself toward a self-sufficient life without electricity.</p><p><b>Stephen Scott</b> became interested in the Plain People while a teenager in southwestern Ohio.

All was quiet in the mansion, for it was not quite dawn, and the dark skies kept most of the mages in their beds with the covers pulled up around them, listening to the rumbling in their dreams.<br> <br>A three-headed tiki statue stood guard in Simber&#x2019;s place to the left of the door, and Jim the winged tortoise, with his brightly colored mosaic shell, floated lazily in the air on the right, his white feather wings flapping just enough to keep him rising and falling without hitting the ceiling or the pedestal below him. They hadn&#x2019;t sensed Simber coming until he burst through the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get Alex and Henry!&#x201d; Thatcher shouted. &#x201c;Bring them to the hospital ward right away!&#x201d; His voice was harsh and gravelly, for he&#x2019;d barely slept in the days it had taken them to return home from the land of the dragons. With Fifer limp in his arms, he slid off Simber&#x2019;s back and stumbled to his knees, his legs numb and body aching from the journey. He got up and hobbled toward the hospital ward as the two statues figured out what was happening. Simber followed Thatcher.<br> <br>Jim flew upstairs with the tiki statue behind him, mysteriously able to glide up the steps on his flat, legless bottom. At the balcony Jim headed for the family hallway to locate Henry Haluki, Artim�&#x2019;s chief healer and Thatcher&#x2019;s partner in all things, while the tiki statue slid to the farthest hallway on the left. Many of Artim�&#x2019;s mages couldn&#x2019;t see that magical hallway&#x2014;they saw a mirror on the wall instead&#x2014;but the tiki statue had no problem finding it. He charged toward Alex&#x2019;s apartment and pounded his top head against the door.<br> <br>In the hospital ward, Thatcher gently lay Fifer on a bed and looked around, feeling helpless and a bit guilty that he knew so little about the medicines Henry had so lovingly created. He went to get a cup of water and a sponge to soak and press against the young twin&#x2019;s parched lips, in hopes that drops of water would seep inside her mouth and trickle down her throat without choking her.<br> <br>While Thatcher lifted Fifer&#x2019;s head and administered the sponge, he swept his troubled gaze over the girl. Her clothing was full of rips and stained dark with blood after Simber, the enormous winged-cheetah statue, had unintentionally smashed through the glass barriers in Dragonsmarche, sending shards like a thousand daggers into Fifer&#x2019;s body. An instant later Fifer&#x2019;s twin, Thisbe, had been snatched up by the Revinir&#x2014;someone Thatcher and Simber had recognized as the former Queen Eagala from Warbler Island, who should&#x2019;ve been dead&#x2014;and taken underground to her lair among the catacombs.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d had to leave Thisbe behind. In order to save Fifer&#x2019;s life, they&#x2019;d flown nonstop for days, all the way to Warbler, where they&#x2019;d learned of even more heartrending news: Sky had been swept underwater into the mouth of the plunging volcanic Island of Fire and was gone.<br> <br>Thatcher heard a commotion on the stairs and looked up, feeling his heart in his throat. He and Simber had a lot of explaining to do, and there was no easy way to go about it. Delivering this news to Alex was the hardest thing Thatcher had ever faced, including everything he&#x2019;d just been through.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank goodness,&#x201d; Thatcher murmured when he saw Henry racing toward him, one arm slid inside the sleeve of his healer&#x2019;s coat, the rest of it flying behind. The two quickly embraced; then Henry slipped his other arm into the jacket and reached for his medical supplies. &#x201c;Tell me everything,&#x201d; he demanded.<br> <br>Before Thatcher or Simber could begin to tell him, Alex arrived inside the ward. At the sight of his sister on the bed he paled, and his mouth slacked in shock. &#x201c;What happened? Is she okay? How did this come about?&#x201d; He looked around frantically. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Thisbe? Carina said&#x2014;Carina told me&#x2014; You were all supposed to be coming right behind them!&#x201d;<br> <br>Simber looked to Thatcher to fill in everyone as Henry began assessing Fifer&#x2019;s condition, then working on her wounds, cleaning them and applying the magical plant-based concoctions he&#x2019;d developed over the years. Thatcher spoke hastily about what had transpired after Carina and Seth had left the castle Grimere with the five young dragons. Things had not gone as planned.<br> <br>Alex listened, stunned. He could hardly take in the information about Thisbe or how the Revinir had snatched her up and disappeared. Or who the old woman really was. &#x201c;Queen Eagala is the Revinir?&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;How can that be? She&#x2019;s been dead for over ten years!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Simber. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m cerrrtain it was herrr.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have to go after Thisbe,&#x201d; Alex said, growing frantic. &#x201c;She must be absolutely sick with fear! But Fifer&#x2014;is she . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go after Thisbe,&#x201d; said Thatcher, trying to calm Alex down. &#x201c;Shortly we&#x2019;ll start to organize and figure out a plan for that. But . . .&#x201d; He gave Simber a pleading look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rrright,&#x201d; said Simber in a grave voice. &#x201c;Alex, therrre&#x2019;s . . . something else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex looked at Simber. His hand shook, and he reached for a bedpost. &#x201c;Something else?&#x201d; he said weakly. &#x201c;What more could there possibly be?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simber&#x2019;s body sagged, and he closed his eyes as if he couldn&#x2019;t bear to see Alex hurt even more. After an agonizing moment, he opened them and looked squarely at the mage. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Sky,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;She was worrrking on the Island of Firrre, and it plunged below the waterrr without warrrning. She was swept in.&#x201d; He paused for a moment as he watched Alex, dazed, sink heavily to the bed next to Fifer&#x2019;s. And then Simber growled, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><h2>Snow White with the Red Hair, Vol. 2 (2)</h2><p>A romantic retelling of a classic fairy tale about a beautiful herbalist and a lovestruck prince.<br><br>Shirayuki is an herbalist famous for her naturally bright-red hair, and the prince of Tanbarun wants her all to himself!

It happened between June 2015 and November 2016. Okay, that's a little more than a year.<br><br> Everything you are about to read in this book is true, as far as I know. I don't expect you to believe all of it. (Who could?) But I promise it is true, to the best of my knowledge.<br><br> I've waited decades to deliver the message in this book. I waited because the world wasn't ready, but also because the messenger-yours truly-didn't have the skill to deliver it right. The story was too hard to tell. But it was important, and it needed to be told.<br><br> And so I waited.<br><br> And I learned.<br><br> And I practiced.<br><br> And I waited some more.<br><br> Then it happened.<br><br> On June 16, 2015, Donald J. Trump rode a golden elevator in Trump Tower to the lobby, where he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. Like most observers at the time, I didn't fully understand what I was seeing. It wasn't until the first Republican primary debate that I realized what was happening right before our eyes. Trump was no ordinary politician. He was no ordinary businessperson either. In fact, he wasn't ordinary in any sense of the word.<br><br> Trump is what I call a Master Persuader. That means he has weapons-grade persuasion skills. Based on my background in that field, I recognized his talents early. And after watching him in action during the election, I have to say that Trump is the most persuasive human I have ever observed.<br><br> President Trump carried those persuasion skills into the White House, where his supporters say he has gotten a lot done, and his critics say he hasn't. Supporters pointed to a decrease in illegal immigration, a strong stock market (at this writing), high consumer confidence, progress fighting ISIS, a solid Supreme Court nominee, and a stronger-than-expected foreign policy game. Critics saw "chaos" in the administration, slow progress on health-care reform, and maybe some kind of nefarious connections with Russia.<br><br> President Trump's critics (and mine) asked me how I could call the president a Master Persuader when his public approval levels were in the cellar. The quick answer is that low approval didn't stop him from winning the presidency. And according to his supporters, it didn't stop him from getting things done on the job. His persuasion skills, combined with the power of the presidency, were all he needed. Keep in mind that disapproving of Trump's style and personality is a social requirement for people who long for a more civil world. Effectiveness is a separate issue from persuasive skill.<br><br> But here's the fun part: I also believed that Trump-the Master Persuader-was going to do far more than win the presidency. I expected Trump to rip a hole in the fabric of reality so we could look through it to a deeper truth about the human experience. And he did exactly that.<br><br> But not everyone noticed. That's why I made it the theme of this book.<br><br> The common worldview, shared by most humans, is that there is one objective reality, and we humans can understand that reality through a rigorous application of facts and reason. This view of the world imagines that some people have already achieved a fact-based type of enlightenment that is compatible with science and logic, and they are trying to help the rest of us see the world the "right" way. As far as I can tell, most people share that interpretation of the world. The only wrinkle with that worldview is that we all think we are the enlightened ones. And we assume the people who disagree with us just need better facts, and perhaps better brains, in order to agree with us. That filter on life makes most of us happy-because we see ourselves as the smart ones-and it does a good job of predicting the future, but only because confirmation bias (our tendency to interpret data as supporting our views) will make the future look any way we want it to look, within reason.<br><br> What I saw with Trump's candidacy for president is that the "within reason" part of our understanding about reality was about to change, bigly. I knew that candidate Trump's persuasion skills were about to annihilate the public's ability to understand what they were seeing, because their observations wouldn't fit their mental model of living in a rational world. The public was about to transition from believing-with total certainty-"the clown can't win" to "Hello, President Trump." And in order to make that transition, they would have to rewrite every movie playing in their heads. To put it in simple terms, the only way Trump could win was if everything his critics understood about the true nature of reality was wrong.<br><br> Then Trump won.<br><br> That's what I mean by "ripping a hole in the fabric of the universe." Think of it as the moment your entire worldview dissolves in front of your eyes, and you have to rebuild it from scratch. As a trained persuader, I found this situation thrilling beyond words. And I was about to get a lot of company, once people realized what they were seeing.<br><br> I'll help you find the hole that Trump punched through the universe so you can look through it with me to the other side. Put a seat belt on your brain-you're going to need it.<br><br> Before we go further, I need to tell you that Trump's stated policies during the campaign did not align with my political preferences. Nor do my views line up with Clinton's stated policies during the race. I realize this is hard to believe, so I'll need to give you some examples to make the point. This little detour is necessary so you can judge my political bias. It is important context because the message is always connected to the messenger. If you are a regular reader of my blog, you can probably skip this part.<br><br> I label myself an ultraliberal, and by that I mean liberals seem too conservative to me. I'll give you some examples:<br><br> Generally speaking, conservatives want to ban abortion while liberals want it to remain legal. I go one step further and say that men should sideline themselves from the question and follow the lead of women on the topic of reproductive health. (Men should still be in the conversation about their own money, of course.) Women take on most of the burden of human reproduction, including all of the workplace bias, and that includes even the women who don't plan to have kids. My personal sense of ethics says that the people who take the most responsibility for important societal outcomes should also have the strongest say. My male opinion on women's reproductive health options adds nothing to the quality of the decision. Women have it covered. The most credible laws on abortion are the ones that most women support. And when life-and-death issues are on the table, credibility is essential to the smooth operation of society. My opinion doesn't add credibility to the system. When I'm not useful, I like to stay out of the way.<br><br> Generally speaking, conservatives are opposed to legalization of marijuana whereas liberals are more likely to support it. I go one step further and suggest that doctors prescribe recreational drugs for old people to make their final years enjoyable. What do they have to lose? (Yes, I'm serious. I know it's hard to tell.)<br><br> When it comes to complicated issues about economics and foreign affairs, my opinion is that I never have enough data to form competent opinions. Neither does anyone else. My opinion of my own limitations doesn't match that of any politician. They pretend they have enough information to make informed decisions.<br><br> Generally speaking, conservatives think we live in a country where everyone already has equal opportunity. Liberals generally think the government should do more to guarantee equal opportunity. I go one step further and suggest considering slavery reparations for African Americans in the form of free college and job training, funded by a twenty-five-year tax on the top 1 percent. In the long run, I want free education for all, but you have to start someplace. No matter who goes first, it will seem unfair to everyone else. So why not let African Americans in low-income families go first? Keep in mind that helping the demographic group that is in the deepest hole gives society the biggest economic bang for the buck. And when society is prosperous, most of it flows right back into the pockets of the 1 percent, making their taxes for this purpose almost an investment.<br><br> I hope those are enough examples to make my point. I'm not on any political team, and I like it that way.<br><br> Policies aside, I was clearly a Trump "supporter" in the sense that I spoke glowingly of his persuasion skills, his humor, and his business talent. I was among the first observers-some say the first-to identify his political maneuvering as solid strategies borrowed from the business world. I was making that point while most pundits were labeling him an unhinged clown. I know a lot about business because I've observed it, and lived it, in a lot of ways. I write about business in the Dilbert comic, and I've published several business humor books. I also spent sixteen years in corporate America, first at a large bank and later at a phone company. I held about a dozen different jobs at those companies and got to see business from the perspective of technologists, marketers, strategists, leaders, followers, and more. I also have a BA in economics and an MBA from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. And I've managed several different types of businesses of my own. The Dilbert business is a substantial enterprise, and I manage that. I also cofounded a start-up called WhenHub, and I help manage that. I make no claim of being a great businessperson, but I can usually tell the difference between good business practices and bad. Political pundits and writers covering Trump during the campaign generally did not have business experience, and I think that put them at a huge disadvantage in understanding the power of his methods. It wasn't all about persuasion. He also used high-end business strategy all the way, and you wouldn't recognize it as such if you had never spent time in that world.<br><br> As I grew my number of social media followers by attracting Trump supporters, it was fun to play to the audience. They liked pro-Trump humor and content and I enjoyed delivering it. The funniest observers of the election seemed to be on the political right. I'm attracted to funny.<br><br> I did sometimes criticize Trump, and I sometimes praised Clinton when her persuasion game was good. But I made no attempt at balancing the two for the sake of appearances. The mainstream media was doing a good job of covering all of the candidates' flaws and features. My primary interest was the topic of persuasion. And on that dimension, Trump owned the election until the summer of 2016. That's when Clinton's persuasion game went weapons grade and it became a fair fight for the first time.<br><br> If you would like to see my list of Trump's mistakes, I've organized them in appendix D. I did that so you won't think I'm blind to his missteps.<br><br> This is a good place to tell you where my credentials rank in the field of persuasion. I label my persuasion skills commercial grade, meaning I successfully use persuasion in my work. A few levels above me in talent and credibility are cognitive scientists who study this sort of thing for a living. If a cognitive scientist tells you I got something wrong in this book, trust the scientist, not me.<br><br> In my view of the world, the few individuals I call Master Persuaders are a level above cognitive scientists in persuasion power and possess what I call weapons-grade persuasion skills. The qualities that distinguish weapons-grade persuasion from the academic or commercial types are the level of risk taking and the personality that goes with it. Trump the candidate had an appetite for risk, a deep understanding of persuasion, and a personality that the media couldn't ignore. He brought the full package.<br><br> Here's the summary of the persuader types. The most powerful are at the top.<br><br> Master Persuaders (includes several presidents, Steve Jobs, Peggy Noonan, Tony Robbins, Madonna, etc.)<br><br> Cognitive scientists<br><br> Commercial-grade persuaders (people such as me)<br><br> I'll try to compensate for my lack of a PhD in cognitive science by linking to sources where it makes sense. But much of this book is based on decades of personal practice and observation of what works and what doesn't in the realm of persuasion. I encourage readers to remain skeptical and to check any of my claims on their own. A simple Google search will confirm (or debunk?) almost anything I say in this book about persuasion.<br><br> But Scott, Trump Is a Horrible Monster, Isn't He?<br><br> Trump's critics were appalled that I could say anything positive about this horrible monster that they expected to sprout horns at any moment. To them, my so-called support of Trump represented a big risk for the country, and it was the most despicable thing I could do. They worried that my writing would help get this racist, sexist, disrespectful, xenophobic hater elected. And they asked me how I could live with myself as Hitler's Little Helper. Wasn't I taking a risk with the future of the entire planet? Was I putting everyone's life in danger just to have some fun and get some attention?<br><br> The simple answer is that I didn't see any of their concerns as real. In Trump I saw a highly capable yet flawed man trying to make a positive difference. And I saw all of his opponents' fears as the product of heavy-handed political persuasion. No one becomes Hitler at age seventy. We would have seen lots of warning signs during his decades of public life. And I kept in mind that most Republican candidates for president have been painted with the same Hitler brush, and it hasn't been right yet. In a similar fashion, I knew President Obama was not part of an Islamic terrorist sleeper cell, as some of his critics claimed. I saw candidate Trump as the target of the same sort of partisan hysteria. Like much of the public, I saw a scary extremism in Trump's language and policy preferences during the campaign. But I recognized his hyperbole as weapons-grade persuasion that would change after the election, not a sign that Trump had suddenly turned into Hitler.</p><h2>Scout&#39;s Dutch Oven Cookbook</h2><p><p>From "Commissioner's French Toast"&nbsp;to "Chicken Dutchiladas," <i>The Scout's Dutch Oven Cookbook</i> highlights hand-picked outdoor recipes,&nbsp;plus cooking methods and tips for a Scout-friendly cooking experience.

He argues convincingly that the deepest needs of human personality&#x2014;security and significance&#x2014;ultimately cannot be satisfied by a marriage partner. We need to turn to the Lord, rather than our spouse, to satisfy our needs. This frees both partners for "soul oneness," a commitment to minister to our spouse's needs rather than manipulating them to meet our own needs. With "soul oneness" comes renewed "body oneness," where couples enjoy sexual pleasure as an expression and outgrowth of a personal relationship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Marriage Builder</em> also identifies three building blocks essential to constructing marriage: the grace of God, true marriage commitment, and acceptance of one's mate. Discussion questions are included to aid couples who want to dig into it and apply the principles to their own lives and marriages. <em>The Marriage Builder</em> is for anyone who longs to transform marriage from trial to triumph.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Larry Crabb is a well-known psychologist, conference and seminary speaker, Bible teacher, popular author, and founder/director of NewWay Ministries.

Some doctors seem to confuse it with IBS and they try to treat it as though it were IBS. For many patients though, the disease proves to be debilitating and life-altering, and the treatment options offered by one's doctor may not provide effective relief. Because there is a lot of truth in the observation that microscopic colitis can only be truly understood by someone who actually has the disease, one can learn vital information from others who have discovered ways to live with it, and control it, without a need for medications, in many cases.</p><p>This book covers the history of the disease and how it is diagnosed, all of the commonly-prescribed treatment methods, and some of the most successful treatment methods that are generally unknown in the mainstream medical community. It discusses current research that shows promise for the development of future treatments, and it includes the author's theory of how inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disease actually develops, supported by numerous medical research articles.</p><p>Though there are no easy solutions, patients can definitely can get their life back if they are willing to learn more about the disease, and use that knowledge to fine tune their treatment program. This book is a common sense guide for understanding, controlling, and living with microscopic colitis, and it provides insight into ways to help avoid the development of additional autoimmune diseases. This is a revised, up-to-date edition of the original Microscopic Colitis book.</p></p><p>Wayne Persky was born, grew up, and currently lives in Central Texas. He is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, College of Engineering, with postgraduate studies in mechanical engineering, mathematics, and computer science. He has teaching experience in engineering, and business experience in farming and agribusiness. After the onset of severe digestive system and general health problems in the late 1990s, he went through extensive clinical testing, but the GI specialist failed to take biopsies during a colonoscopy exam, and even failed to test for celiac disease. Afterward, not surprisingly, he was told by his gastroenterologist that there was nothing wrong with him. Unable to find a medical solution, he was forced to use his research skills to discover innovative ways to resolve his health issues. After extensive study, he identified the likely source of the problem as food sensitivities. It took a year and a half of avoiding all traces of gluten, plus trial and error experimentation with other foods, and careful record-keeping, to track down all of the food issues. But once he eliminated all of them from his diet, he got his life back. He currently administrates an online microscopic colitis discussion and support forum, while continuing to research medical issues that are not adequately addressed by mainstream medicine. He is also the founder and president of the Microscopic Colitis Foundation.</p><h2>The Nameless City: The Stone Heart (The Nameless City, 2)</h2><p><p><b><i>The Stone Heart </i>is the second book in the Nameless City trilogy from Faith Erin Hicks.</b></p><p>Kaidu and Rat have only just recovered from the assassination attempt on the General of All Blades when more chaos breaks loose in the Nameless City: deep conflicts within the Dao nation are making it impossible to find a political solution for the disputed territory of the City itself. </p><p>To complicate things further, Kaidu is fairly certain he's stumbled on a formula for the lost weapon of the mysterious founders of the City. . . .

Caroline de Maigret and Sophie Mas are back to amuse you with how they find they are modifying their favorite bad-girl behavior as they address beauty, love, seduction as well as lifestyle, family, work, and living alone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are still bohemian iconoclasts saying what you don't expect to hear. They will tell you things aren't what they used to be--when a thirty-year-old guy arrives at a party and does not even glance at you; when you wake up feeling great and everyone tells you how tired you look; you know you're an adult when you're excited just to go home. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neuroses vs. confidence, resistance vs. acceptance, passion vs. serenity, de Maigret and Mas through spirited short stories capture the different stages of ageing--as nostalgic but modern Parisian women. From the privately absurd to the strangely universal, this book captures moments of everyday life that will make the reader nod, cringe, and laugh out loud.</p><p><b>CAROLINE DE MAIGRET</b> is an international model; she has been an ambassador and spokesperson for Chanel since 2013; a music producer at Bonus Tracks Records and fashion video producer for CDM Production.

It is full of rich spiritual wisdom and insight culled from the experience of a man who knew both the sorrows of life and the joys of faith in great abundance.... I pray that many readers will find here the help, comfort, wise counsel, and spiritual compass that we and our friends have so often discovered in meditating on these pages. Sinclair Ferguson - The Loveliness of Christ is a beautiful little gift book containing short extracts in which some of Rutherford s most helpful thoughts are allowed to stand out in their unadorned wisdom and power. Those familiar with Andrew Bonar s great nineteenth-century collection of the Letters of Samuel Rutherford will feel that this setting of brief quotations makes Rutherford s words sparkle like diamonds on a dark cloth in a jeweller s shop. It is not surprising then, that a hundred years ago, H. C. G. Moule, the Anglican Bishop of Durham, said in his simple but elegant commendation of the original edition of The Loveliness of Christ that it was a small casket stored with many jewels . It is the publisher s wish that the reader, in meditating on these pages, will find here help, comfort, wise counsel, and spiritual compass, and to say with Rutherford, Every day we may see some new thing in Christ. His love hath neither brim nor bottom.</p><p>Samuel Rutherford (1600 1661) was a Scottish minister and covenanter best known for his political book, &#34;Lex Rex; or, The Law and the Prince&#34;, for which he was charged with high treason and imprisoned.

They ruin marriages, relationships, destroy churches, and discredit those in spiritual leadership. Even worse, instead of fighting them, believers daily aid these spirits. And daily, other believers fall victim. The church's main problem today is a lack of love, forgiveness, and unity.</p><p>Satan's favorite lie is that spiritual attacks always come from outside&#x2014;that Christians can't hurt each other.

But when Dr. Kynan Bridges rips the mask off of the Accuser, the truth is revealed: Satan&#x2019;s spirits of slander, gossip, and offense are actually using believers to infect the church from the inside out with bitterness and spiritual dissension. And even worse, believers are too often lending them a hand instead of fighting back.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you want to stop working for the devil and instead promote peace and find freedom, this is your guide.

Access to texts such as the <i>Lost Book of Enoch, the Nag Hamadi Gospels, and the Book of Jubilees,</i> among others is now widely available and, when synthesized and correlated with existing documents like the Bible and Qu'ran, merits rethinking Western civilization's origins and intent. </p> <p>Prepare yourself for a profound belief-challenging journey through ancient Persia, Sumer, Greece, and Atlantis; from Rome to the United States, HQ of the New Atlantis. <b>This book is not like any other in the field: expect the winged-warrior aerial perspective of an Army Attack helicopter pilot, the BS filter of an Electrical Engineer, a Western Medicine-challenging Structural Integrator, and Southern California didgeridoo player all at the same time. </b> Energy and matter, sound entrainment, slave control design methods using the electromagnetic spectrum, eternal life, gravity, and DMT are addressed herein. </p> <p>U.S. public school history ignores the Sumerians, although they are credited with all aspects of modern civilization, influencing both Egypt and Greece alike. Television series produced by the History Channel, like the <i>"Ancient Aliens"</i> Series is assisting the masses in waking up to the fact that the Anunnaki were not a myth, having left physical documents and artifacts backing up their claims to have created mankind, described in highly sophisticated language, as recorded by Atrahasis. </p> <p>It was in South Africa, where the idea was spawned to create a primitive worker, namely mankind, to operate the gold mines, provide temple building manpower, and generally serve every whim the Ancient Astronauts from Nibiru conceived of. Many of the Niburians, referenced in the Biblical Genesis as the Elohim, known to the Sumerians as the Anunnaki, were enthroned as Gods in Mesopotamia. </p> <p> Perhaps it is fitting for Westerners to look into the religious and historical origins for the kings and demigods of Sumer, the first culture to provide evidence of the cuneiform script language, complete with no antecedent. Not only were mundane records, detailed as they were, kept on clay tablets, tens of thousands of which survive to this day, but the history and direct experience accounts of some of the famed inhabitants, like king Gilgamesh of Uruk, introduce us to <i>"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came." </i></p><p> </p><p>The Anunnaki astronauts hailed from a planet, Nibiru, in our own solar system, whose apogee resides in a 3,600 retrograde elliptical orbit beyond Pluto. According to their records, likely using spectroscopy as scientists do today, they located gold on planet Earth. Due to a failing atmosphere on Nibiru, Anu their king, dispatched his preeminent scientist and first-born son, Enki, on a space mission to Earth to recover enough gold that could be ionized in a layer of their atmosphere, as a solar radiation shield </p> <p> Anunnaki gold mines in Africa have been found and carbon dated. Mining operations were occurring at the exact time and location that the <i>"Genetic Eve Study" </i>indicates: Womankind's genetic origins are undeniably linked to Enki's gold mining operation. Egyptian Queen Sheba's mines ring a bell? Michael Tellinger followed the Sumerian account to Africa, locating many of the mines, homes and temples used by the primitive workers and gods, our true ancestors. </p><p> </p><p>Additional source material and limited genealogy tables are included in the Bibliography and Appendix for the reader to explore.

Before she leaves, she uncovers a baseball that belonged to her father. It has a mysterious message scrawled across it, "Because...magic," and, like all things relating to her late husband, Izzy's mother won't explain. Nana warmly welcomes her granddaughter to her remote village, a place that seems frozen in time. Izzy meets Nana's friends and neighbors, learns to make tortillas, and watches her grandmother, a <i>curandera</i>, prepare folk remedies. She also begins to uncover the mystery surrounding her father's life and death. Cervantes's prose is lean and lightly spiced with evocative metaphor. Unfortunately, the plot feels all too familiar: the wise grandmother, the loving mother who refuses to speak of the past, and the melodramatic resolution. The characters are gracefully limned yet fail to rise above convention. This gentle family story may hold appeal for those who have enjoyed the works of Pam Mu�oz Ryan and Toby Johnston.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He&#x2019;s left me without excuse! Last, Justin&#x2019;s writing, heart, and wisdom make me so glad to know that Jesus is the spouse I always wanted, and that, by his grace, I can love my wife as he loves me.

I champion any call for men to step out of passivity and dominate the things that matter most&#x2015;<em>Date Your Wife</em> beckons me as a man to do just that. The primacy of being a great husband is undeniable in Scripture and I appreciate this gospel-centered, practical, and powerful resource to help us men step up in the most noble of all roles. I pray God uses <em>Date Your Wife</em> to call up a generation of men who are first and foremost great husbands. I can think of no greater gift to our children, our churches, and our cities than men whose wives are pursued well and have marriages that flourish and go the distance.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Wiley Bryson</strong>, Cofounder and Teaching Pastor, Fellowship Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee; Leadership Coach, Fellowship Associates</p><p>&#x201c;Otis Redding sang &#x2018;Try a little tenderness&#x2019; and some husbands want to&#x2015;but don&#x2019;t know how.

Eight days later, a humbled France accepted defeat along with foreign occupation. While the swastika now flew over Paris, the City of Light was undamaged, and soon a peculiar kind of normalcy returned as theaters, opera houses, movie theaters, and nightclubs reopened for business. Shedding light on this critical moment of twentieth-century European cultural history, <i>And the Show Went On </i>focuses anew on whether artists and writers have a special duty to show moral leadership in moments of national trauma.</p></p><p><p>For twelve years, <b>Alan Riding </b>was the European cultural correspondent for <i>The New York Times</i>. He was previously bureau chief for the <i>Times</i> in Paris, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico City. Riding is the author of <i>Distant Neighbors: A Portrait of the Mexicans</i>. He continues to live in Paris with his wife, Marlise Simons, a writer for the <i>Times</i>.</p>� c h a p t e r&nbsp; 1 �<br>Everyone on Stage<br>&nbsp;<br>ON JUNE 14, 1940, the German army drove into Paris unopposed. Within weeks, the remnants of French democracy were quietly buried and the Third Reich settled in for an indefinite occupation of France. Who was to blame? With the country on its knees, many in France now saw this as a defeat foretold, a debacle that had been in the making since France emerged from World War I, victorious in name but shattered in spirit. In the bloody and muddy trenches of theWestern Front, 1.4 million Frenchmen died, representing 3.5 percent of the population and almost 10 percent of working-age men. Further, the 1 million Frenchmen who were left badly maimed, those ever-present <i>mutil�s de guerre</i>, made it impossible to forget the past. With France already alarmed by its low prewar birthrate, this slaughter ofmen and future fathers meant that it was not until 1931 that the country exceeded its 1911 population of 41.4 million&#x2014;and, even then, this was in large part thanks to immigration.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the same time, the country was being let down by its political class. The Third Republic, founded in 1870 after France&#x2019;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, was plagued by instability and consumed by political bickering. Although the economy fared relatively well in the 1920s, postwar reconstruction lagged far behind. Then, in the 1930s, confronted by the twin threats of the Great Depression and the spread of extremist ideologies across Europe, France&#x2019;s rulers chose to ignore both. In a country that had long boasted the originality of its political ideas, a string of dysfunctional governments eroded public faith in democracy and boosted the appeal of the Nazi, Fascist and Communist alternatives. Most critically, with the Great War spawning a nation of pacifists, the French preferred to ignore mounting evidence that the country would soon again be at war with Germany. And when war became inevitable, they chose to believe official propaganda boasting that their army was invincible. This monumental self-delusion only compounded the shock at what followed. When Hitler&#x2019;s army swept across western Europe in the spring of 1940, French defenses crumbled in a matter of weeks. Neither 1870 nor 1914 had been this bad.<br><br>Yet even in the deepening gloom of the interwar years, as artistic and intellectual freedoms were being extinguished across Europe, Paris continued to shine as a cultural beacon. The majority of Parisians were poor, but they had long since been evicted from the elegant heart of Paris by Baron Haussmann&#x2019;s drastic urban redesign a half century earlier. This &#x201c;new&#x201d; Paris was the favored arena of elitist divertimento, drawing minor royalty, aristocrats and millionaires to buy art, to race their horses in the Bois de Boulogne, to hear Richard Strauss conduct <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> at the Paris Opera, to party in the latest Chanel and Schiaparelli designs.<br><br>Painters, writers, musicians and dancers also flocked there from across Europe and the Americas, in some cases seeking sexual freedom, in others fleeing dictatorships, in many hoping for inspiration and recognition. Embracing everything from the literary solemnity of the Acad�mie Fran�aise through the avant-garde of Surrealism to the high kicks of the Moulin Rouge, Paris offered both enlightenment and entertainment. And wandering across its pages and stages like eloquent courtesans were intellectuals, artists and performers. Whether admired for their ideas, their imagination or simply their Bohemian lifestyle, they enjoyed the trappings of a privileged caste. &#x201c;The prestige of the writer was something peculiarly French, I believe,&#x201d; the astute essayist Jean Gu�henno later wrote. &#x201c;In no other country of the world was the writer treated with such reverence by the people. Each bourgeois family might fear that its son would become an artist, but the French bourgeoisie as a group was in agreement in giving the artist and the writer an almost sacred preeminence.&#x201d; Put differently, culture had become inseparable from France&#x2019;s very image of itself. And the rest of Europe recognized this. But with the swastika now flying over Paris, how would French culture&#x2014; its artists, writers and intellectuals, as well as its great institutions&#x2014; respond? Again, the answer lay in the turmoil of the interwar years.<br><br>Nowhere was French cultural leadership greater than in the visual arts. Between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I alone, art movements born in France&#x2014; Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Les Nabis, Fauvism and Cubism&#x2014; succeeded one another in what came to resemble a permanent revolution. The 1914&#x2013;18 conflict did little to disrupt this. While German artists like Otto Dix, George Grosz and Max Beckmann addressed the nightmare of trench warfare, artists in France paid little heed to a war being fought barely a hundred miles north of Paris. When it was over, those&nbsp; nineteenth-century giants Renoir, Monet and Rodin were still alive, while the influence of Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp and Henri Matisse continued to grow. Many artists with prewar reputations, men like Georges Braque, Andr� Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Kees van Dongen, Pierre Bonnard and Aristide Maillol, also remained faithful to their prewar styles. Fernand L�ger was a rare exception. After he spent two years on the front, his art was transformed, with his sketches of artillery and planes anticipating his tubular &#x201c;mechanical&#x201d; paintings of the 1920s. Bonnard avoided the trenches, serving briefly as a war artist and painting just one scene of desolation, <i>Un Village en ruines pr�s du Ham</i>. But he quickly returned to his cherished themes of nudes and interior scenes.<br><br>For European artists, Paris was the place to meet great artists and to aspire to become great oneself. And it helped that the city was an important art market. From the late 1890s, the legendary dealer Ambroise Vollard carried the names of C�zanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh abroad and, in 1901, he gave Picasso his first exhibition in Paris. In the interwar years, it was the turn of other dealers, notably Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and the Rosenberg brothers, L�once and Paul, to keep European and American collectors supplied with the new art from Paris. For foreign artists, the city&#x2019;s energy, bubbling away in the studios and caf�s of the Left Bank, was as appealing as any specific art movement. True, Salvador Dal�, Max Ernst, Man Ray and Joan Mir� embraced Surrealism, but other foreigners went their own ways, among them Constantin Brancusi, Cha�m Soutine, Piet Mondrian, Amedeo Modigliani and Alberto Giacometti. The list of prominent French artists in Paris at that time was even longer. And to these could be added the architects and designers who created Art Deco as a style that would define the 1930s. Probably at no time since the Italian Renaissance had one city boasted such a remarkable concentration of artistic brilliance.<br><br>In the performing arts, change came from abroad, with Sergei Diaghilev&#x2019;s Ballets Russes leading a revolution in dance that would influence ballet for much of the twentieth century. In 1912, the troupe&#x2019;s star dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky, shocked Paris with his erotic interpretation of Claude Debussy&#x2019;s <i>Pr�lude � l&#x2019;apr�s- midi d&#x2019;un faune</i>. The following year, the dancer was at the center of a riot in the Th��tre des Champs- �lys�es during the premiere of Igor Stravinsky&#x2019;s <i>Rite of Spring</i>, when some spectators mutinied against Nijinsky&#x2019;s unorthodox choreography and the music&#x2019;s disturbingly primitive rhythm.<br><br>Diaghilev&#x2019;s role as a promoter and organizer of talent was still more important. Among choreographers, he recruited Michel Fokine, already a major figure in Russian dance, and he made the names of L�onide Massine, Bronislava Nijinska (the dancer&#x2019;s sister) and George Balanchine. Among dancers, along with the inimitable Nijinsky, he turned the English-born Alicia Markova and the Russians Tamara Karsavina and Serge Lifar into international stars (Lifar later also ran the Paris Opera Ballet). A strong believer in the &#x201c;total art&#x201d; that Wagner had called<i> Gesamtkunstwerk</i>, Diaghilev also pulled different art forms together as never before. He invited Derain, Rouault and Picasso, as well as the Russian artists L�on Bakst and Alexandre Benois, to design his stage sets. And while his favorite composer was Stravinsky, who also wrote <i>The Firebird</i>, <i>Petrouchka</i>, <i>Les Noces</i> and<i> Apollo</i> for the company, Diaghilev commissioned ballets from Sergei Prokofiev, Maurice Ravel, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc and Strauss. One memorable example of &#x201c;total art&#x201d; was <i>Parade</i>, a ballet that was conceived by the artist-poet Jean Cocteau and combined music by Erik Satie, choreography by Massine, scenario by Cocteau himself, set, curtain and costumes by Picasso and program notes by Guillaume Apollinaire. First performed at the Th��tre du Ch�telet in Paris on May 18, 1917, it, too, caused a scandal.<br><br>Diaghilev never returned to Russia. By the time of his death, in 1929, other Russian artists and writers&#x2014; among them the painters Marc Chagall and Natalia Goncharova&#x2014; had fled the Bolshevik Revolution for the safety of Paris. After Hitler took power in 1933, it was the turn of more artists and intellectuals, many of them Jews, to seek refuge in France; these included the abstract painter Wassily Kandinsky and the composer Arnold Sch�nberg, as well as the writers Joseph Roth, Hannah Arendt and Walter Benjamin.<br><br>Other foreigners found a different kind of liberty in Paris. When the novelist Edith Wharton settled in France shortly before World War I, the experimental writer Gertrude Stein was already receiving the likes of Picasso and Matisse in her Left Bank apartment at 27 rue de Fleurus, where she lived with her lesbian partner, Alice B. Toklas. In the 1920s and1930s, Stein became a kind of eccentric matron to the &#x201c;lost generation&#x201d; of American writers, notably Ernest Hemingway, Thornton Wilder, John Dos Passos, Ezra Pound and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Henry Miller moved in a different&#x2014; and more impecunious&#x2014; circle, but he, too, enjoyed a freedom that, he later noted, &#x201c;I never knew in America.&#x201d; Little wonder, since three of his 1930s novels, <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>, <i>Black Spring</i> and <i>Tropic of Capricorn</i>, were banned in the United States as obscene. One gathering point for both American and French writers was Shakespeare &amp; Company, the Left Bank bookstore that Sylvia Beach had opened at 12 rue de l&#x2019;Od�on, across the street from La Maison des Amis des Livres, run by her friend and lover, Adrienne Monnier. Beach also came to the rescue of James Joyce, who had moved to Paris in 1920; with American and British publishers shying away from Joyce, fearing charges of obscenity, she dared to publish his monumental <i>Ulysses</i> in 1922. In the late 1930s, Samuel Beckett followed Joyce to Paris, equally determined to escape the suffocating strictures of deeply Catholic Ireland. Their relationship became strained only when Joyce&#x2019;s troubled daughter, Lucia, fell for Beckett&#x2014; and Beckett did not reciprocate.<br><br>Josephine Baker, the black American dancer and singer, was another who flourished in the artistic melting pot of interwar Paris. Happy to escape racial discrimination in the United States, she arrived in Paris in 1925 to perform <i>La Revue n�gre</i> at the Th��tre des Champs-�lys�es with a black American dance troupe; almost immediately, she was hired away by Les Folies Berg�re. There, she became a star, winning over Parisians with her erotic and funny cabaret shows, which included her love song to Paris, &#x201c;J&#x2019;ai deux amours, mon pays et Paris,&#x201d; and her trademark &#x201c;Danse sauvage&#x201d; performed bare breasted and wearing just a skirt of artificial bananas. Soon she was also exploiting her exotic image in French movies like <i>Zou- Zou</i> and <i>Princesse Tam Tam</i>, where she played a Tunisian shepherdess&#x2013;turned&#x2013;Parisian princess in true Pygmalion style. In 1934, she even sang the title role in Offenbach&#x2019;s operetta <i>La Cr�ole</i>. It helped that, at a time when the French were becoming increasingly xenophobic, black American culture was all the rage in Paris. Above all, jazz and swing brought by black Americans was enthusiastically adopted by French musicians, none more brilliant than the Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt and his Hot Club de France. La Baker, as she was known, was not the only cabaret diva. Music halls and cabarets were by far the most popular entertainment in Paris and, by the time �dith Piaf joined Josephine on the scene in 1935, L�o Marjane and particularly Mistinguett&#x2014; La Miss&#x2014; had long been queens of the night. Press speculation that La Miss and La Baker were feuding only helped to pull in the crowds. Male crooners like Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi and bandleaders like Ray Ventura were no less admired.</p><h2>This Is Chance!: The Shaking of an All-American City, A Voice That Held It Together</h2><p><b>The thrilling, cinematic story of a community shattered by disaster&#x2014;and the extraordinary woman who helped pull it back together</b><br><br> In 1964, Anchorage, Alaska, was a modern-day frontier town yearning to be a metropolis&#x2014;the largest, proudest city in a state that was still brand-new. But just before sundown on Good Friday, the community was jolted by the most powerful earthquake in American history, a catastrophic 9.2 on the Richter Scale.

The city was in disarray and sealed off from the outside world.<br><br>Slowly, people switched on their transistor radios and heard a woman&#x2019;s familiar voice explaining what had just happened and what to do next.

Genie&#x2019;s tireless broadcasts over the next three days would transform her into a legendary figure in Alaska and bring her fame worldwide&#x2014;but only briefly, before her story faded away as quickly as it had surfaced after the quake. That Easter weekend in Anchorage, Genie and an entire cast of endearingly eccentric characters&#x2014;from a mountaineering psychologist to the local community theater group staging <i>Our Town&#x2014;</i>were thrown into a jumbled world they could not recognize.

Yet Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author Annie Dillard avers <i>Moby-Dick </i>is the &#x201c;best book ever written about nature,&#x201d; and nearly the entirety of the story is set on the waves, with scarcely a whiff of land. In fact, Ishmael&#x2019;s sea yarn is in conversation with the nature writing of Emerson and Thoreau, and Melville himself did much more than live for a year in a cabin beside a pond. He set sail: to the far remote Pacific Ocean, spending more than three years at sea before writing his masterpiece in 1851.<br><br> A revelation for <i>Moby-Dick </i>devotees and neophytes alike, <i>Ahab&#x2019;s Rolling Sea </i>is a chronological journey through the natural history of Melville&#x2019;s novel. From white whales to whale intelligence, giant squids, barnacles, albatross, and sharks, Richard J. King examines what Melville knew from his own experiences and the sources available to a reader in the mid-1800s, exploring how and why Melville might have twisted what was known to serve his fiction. King then climbs to the crow&#x2019;s nest, setting Melville in the context of the American perception of the ocean in 1851&#x2014;at the very start of the Industrial Revolution and just before the publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. King compares Ahab&#x2019;s and Ishmael&#x2019;s worldviews to how we see the ocean today: an expanse still immortal and sublime, but also in crisis. And although the concept of stewardship of the sea would have been entirely foreign, if not absurd, to Melville, King argues that Melville&#x2019;s narrator Ishmael reveals his own tendencies toward what we would now call environmentalism.<br><br> Featuring a coffer of illustrations and an array of interviews with contemporary scientists, fishers, and whale watch operators, <i>Ahab&#x2019;s Rolling Sea</i> offers new insight not only into a cherished masterwork and its author but also into our evolving relationship with the briny deep&#x2014;from whale hunters to climate refugees.</p><p><b>Richard J.

Melville has combined the rational, objective, Darwinian perspective with the emotional, poetic, Emersonian perspective, pushing the reader to see nature as both dangerous and damaged.

More than establishing a factual basis for Ishmael&#x2019;s fiction-making, King writes passionately on climate change, economic pressures on sea creatures, and the future Melville confronts in his marvelous encounter with the &#x2018;wonder-world&#x2019; of whaling. King&#x2019;s deep knowledge grounds lively storytelling, keen observations drawn from years of sailing, and an eye for details that will make Melville&#x2019;s book come alive.

It's the weird rumor that the marlin is linked to a missing treasure. It's the truck that seems to be following Birdie and the bad feeling on the back of her neck.<br>When Birdie and Bowser start digging into the mystery, not even Bowser's powerful sniffer can smell just how menacing the threat is.

His novels for kids include the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Bowser and Birdie novel, <i>Woof</i>, and the follow-up <i>Arf</i>, as well as the Edgar-Award nominated Echo Falls series. Spencer lives with his wife, Diana, and dogs, Audrey and Pearl, on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Two humans, Birdie Gaux and her grandmother, are standing in front of Bowser's cage at the shelter. It's Birdie's 11th birthday, and she's there to pick out a pet. The girl automatically connects with mutt Bowser, even though Grammy and the woman running the shelter advise against him. Bowser is beside himself&#x2014;he has connected with Birdie, too. Soon they are speeding along in Grammy's beat up pick up truck, headed to St. Roch, LA. Before Bowser can even get settled in, he and Birdie have a mystery on their hands. Someone has stolen Grammy's prized mounted marlin, Black Jack, from the wall of her bait and swamp tour shop. It turns out that Birdie's small town harbors quite a few secrets and old family feuds. Bowser and Birdie must find Grammy's prized marlin and dig into the age-old rumor that there is a treasure map sealed within Black Jack. Told from Bowser's point of view, this hilarious story will elicit laughs from dog-loving kids as they recognize Bowser's loyal yet rambunctious behavior.

As the new powers&#x2014;China and India from Asia and others from Africa and Latin America&#x2014;rise to the top of the world's pecking order, how should the West react? Kishore Mahbubani argues passionately and provocatively that the West can no longer impose its power and ideals on the world at large, and&#x2014;paradoxically&#x2014;that only by admitting its decline can the West set itself up for strategic success in the long term. Mahbubani examines the myths and self-delusions of Western power with an outsider's critical eye, and the shocking freshness of his geopolitical analysis will give all Westerners and political thinkers pause for thought.</p><p><b>Kishore Mahbubani</b> is a Professor in the Practice of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.

Summers, former Chief Economist of the World Bank<br><br>"As Asia steadily advances to the centre of the world's stage, has the West properly noticed that huge change? Can it amend itself intelligently, and without as simple knee-jerk reaction? Can the United States in particular come to grips with global transformations? These questions are at the center of Kishore Mahbubani's pointed and provocative new discourse, based upon his long acquaintance with both East and West. It's a powerful, disputatious book, and provides much meat for all readers who will want to dispute it. It's not comfortable reading, and it wasn't meant to be." &#x2014;Paul Kennedy, Director of International Security Studies and Professor of History at Yale University<br><br>"Kishore Mahbubani's depiction of Western thought leaders as not willing to read the writing on the wall reminds me of the confident mandarins of late Qing China who dismissed the possibility of a world emerging that could challenge their superior system. His call for action suggests that, if the West takes heed, they could escape the Qing mandarins' fate." &#x2014;Wang Gungwu, Professor, National University of Singapore<br><br>"The West talks a big game, but is it built to last?

It situates different musics in their cultural and historical context, and analyses them in terms of cultural aesthetics. Paul Hegarty argues that noise is a judgement about sound, that what was noise can become acceptable as music, and that in many ways the idea of noise is similar to the idea of the avant-garde. </p><p>While it provides an excellent historical overview, the book's main concern is in the noise music that has emerged since the mid 1970s, whether through industrial music, punk, free jazz, or the purer noise of someone like Merzbow. The book progresses seamlessly from discussions of John Cage, Erik Satie, and Pauline Oliveros through to bands like Throbbing Gristle and the Boredoms. Sharp and erudite, and underpinned throughout by the ideas of thinkers like Adorno and Deleuze, Noise/Music is the perfect primer for anyone interested in the louder side of experimental music.</p></p><p>Paul Hegarty teaches Philosophy and Visual Culture at University College Cork, in Ireland. He is the author of Noise/Music (Continuum, 2007). He jointly runs the experimental record label dotdotdotmusic, and performs in the noise bands Safe and La Soci�t� des Amis du Crime. <br>Can silence be "noisy"? Why do punk banks downplay their musical abilities? What do 37 minutes of ceaseless feedback and squawking birds tell us about the human experience? Calling upon the work of noted cultural critics like Jean Baudrillard, George Bataille and Theodor Adorno, philosophy and visual culture professor Paul Hegarty delves into these questions while tracing the history of "noise" (defined at different times as "intrusive, unwanted," "lacking skill, not being appropriate" and "a threatening emptiness") from the beginnings of the 18th century concert hall music to avant-garde movements like musique concrete and free jazz to Japanese noise rocker Merzbow. Ironically, it is John Cage's notorious 4'33", in which an audience sits through four and a half minutes of "silence," that represents the beginning of noise music proper for Hegarty; the "music" made up entirely of incidental theater sounds (audience members coughing, the A/C's hum), represents perfectly the tension between the "desirable" sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable "noise" that makes up all noise music, from Satie to punk. Hegarty does an admirable job unpacking diverse genres of music, and his descriptions of the most bizarre pieces can be great fun to read ("clatters and reverbed chickeny sounds...come in over low throbs"). Though his style tends toward the academic (the "dialectic of Enlightenment" and Heidegger appear frequently), Hegarty's wit and knowledge make this an engaging read.&#x2014;Publishers Weekly<br> "In this rigorously researched deconstruction of noise, Paul Hegarty explains how the concept is entirely contingent upon social norms and how its inevitable emergence into music, which is simply organized noise, unfolded. <br>Hegarty begins by arguing for the concept of noise as a socially undesirable them to the musical elites us. He then leads us on a dense yet speedy tour of pivotal moments in the evolution of noise into a component of music, focusing on salient benchmarks the Italian Futurists, recording technology, Fluxus, John Cage, Merzbow and hip-hop. By the time Hegarty arrives at modern manifestations of noise, genre neophytes will consider themselves experts. But be warned: This is not a pop history. It's an academic survey with a distinct poststructuralist ?avor, an informative read, but not a particularly fun one, unless of course you read Derrida for giggles."<b> </b><i>Paste Magazine </i>/ July 2007 (Paste Magazine)<br><br><p>"An intertwined crash course in outsider music and cultural studies, Paul Hegarty's dense new survey, <i>Noise/Music: A History</i>,traces noise music's avant-garde and experimental roots&#x2014;from Futurism,Fluxus, and musique concr�te to 1970s progressive rock and punk&#x2014;andexamines its more recent incarnations.</p><p><br>One noise-engaging genre is jazz, the subject of Hegarty's mostcompelling chapter, in which he investigates Adorno's infamousdismissal of the form in a 1936 essay...Hegarty also offers a freshanalysis of free jazz's abstractions, tying the subgenre's oscillationbetween form and content, its 'attack on tonality,' and its 'introduction of non-musical noises' to Bataille's concept of the 'formless.'</p><p>The book's selected discography..should satisfy both the curious and the "extreme" enthusiast...it's a reminder thatthere's 'no sound, no noise, no silence,' without our activeparticipation." -Bookforum Sept. 2007<br></p><br><br><p><b>Fear of music</b></p><p>"Noise and its relationship to music &#x2014; and noise as music &#x2014; is asuitably chaotic and mercurial subject with much hissing feedback.According to author Paul Hegarty in <b><i>Noise/Music, A History</i> (Continuum, 232 pages, $22.95)</b>, noise is "defined by what it is not" and "a resistance, but also defined by what society resists."</p><p>In his phenomenal study, he provides a history and a sense ofthat contradiction. Until now, most investigations into noise and musichave been chiefly concerned with chronicling early innovators like JohnCage or Karlheinz Stockhausen, but usually at the cost of the last 30years being framed as aftershocks of modernism and not developments intheir own right. Noise, in Hegarty's estimation, has evolved farbeyond, as a resource and into an aesthetic philosophy. </p><p>This could placate all denominations &#x2014; from beardedimprovisers to black-clad nihilists &#x2014; and feels more correct than anylinear conception of successive avant-gardes following one another.Exhaustive without being exhausting, Hegarty lucidly works his waythrough the last 100 years of music and untangles dogmas and ideologiesranging from Theodor Adorno's immensely flawed approach to jazz to thevalorization of ineptitude by punks and composers alike. Hegartyrefreshingly places his history around recent noise &#x2014; as he says "noiseitself constantly dissipates ... noise music must also be thought of asconstantly failing &#x2014; failing to stay noise or acceptable practice."This approach is open enough for sudden leaps and insight. For everyobsessive exegesis on Merzbow, there's his consideration of PublicEnemy as an industrial band or his original take on the minimalist jamsof garage and Kraut-rock bands: "the long tracks of proto-punk are adirect erasing of the meandering 'expressions' musicians were doingmore and more, live and on album. It is not enough just to reject thelong form (as the Ramones would do); it is far more effective to wreckthe purpose of it through the form itself." Any disruption, in otherwords, can be noise &#x2014; such as Eric Satie's tranquil pianos works &#x2014; whenconsidered as "a rebellion against the growing complexity of classicalmusic in the late 19th and early 20th century."</p><p>Noise, as music, is any moment when all structure and notionsof beauty are called into question. As a whole we need noise, and anyadventurous listener needs Hegarty's book. Wonderfully written, eventhe footnotes are a treasure trove (like this great working definitionof prog: "the narcissism of brilliance signifying itself") and morethan just another music theory book, it acts as a secret philosophicaltreatise on the calamities of the 20th century and the intensities ofnow." </p><p>-Eye Weekly</p><br><br>"...a personal meditation on how various aesthetic, socio-political andphilosophical approaches and ideas can be applied to music and sound.

Acres of classical buildings, constructed especially for the fair, created an urban wonderland; it glittered with artistic splendor and burgeoned with America's latest technological achievements. After a visit to this White City, the French novelist and critic Paul Bourget wrote: "Chicago, the enormous town we see expanding, the gigantic plant which grows before our eyes seems now in this wonderfully new country to be in advance of the age. But is not this more or less true of all America?"Bourget's comment was the kind Americans liked to quote; the exposition's exhibitors displayed their hopes for their country and for the world. Contrived and temporary, this Dream City flaunted America's faiths and glossed over its contradictions. Glamour triumphed over decay; time seemed suspended near the peak of perfection. From John Winthrop to Ralph Waldo Emerson to Josiah Strong, many Americans had thought, or hoped, that their country had escaped from history, that America was not just another power that would rise and then decline but that it was the quintessential civilization that would permanently culminate some long progression toward human betterment. Here, in rhetoric, iron, and stone, were the ideas and products that Americans prized and believedothers would gratefully accept. In the Dream City, America's most significant gifts to the twentieth-century world were already apparent: advanced technology and mass culture.The amazing scientific and technological innovations of America's farmers--displayed in Agriculture Hall--overwhelmed viewers and demonstrated the United States' importance as an exporter of primary products. Impressive displays of wheat, corn, and other crops from the prairie states bespoke opulence and plenty. In this pavilion, at least, there was no mention of the overproduction, the falling prices, and the crushing debts plaguing the Midwest and attracting converts to the populist revolt.Perched on a platform in one section of Agriculture Hall was a huge globe with an array of farm machines, all American-made, revolving around its circumference. America's preeminence in agricultural machinery was unmistakable, and manufacturers looked toward potential markets in the new and still-expanding farming frontiers of Manchuria, Siberia, Australia, Mexico, and Argentina. America's leading food processors, some already well known abroad, also displayed their latest techniques and products: Cudahy and Swift proudly showed beef extract; Gail Borden lined up cans of condensed milk; sugar refiners and soapmakers touted their innovations.Transportation Hall showed off the "engines of progress" that had opened the prairies to commercial cultivation. Railroad companies built massive Grecian-style pavilions and used full-size models to illustrate the historical development of locomotives. The Pullman Company escorted visitors through an entire train, to show its luxurious sleeping and dining quarters. The railroad's prominent place at Chicago seemed appropriate: promoters presented the railroad as a major civilizing force, one bringing prosperity, communication, and understanding to the world.The Pullman Company treated fairgoers to a large model of its other proud creation--the industrial town of Pullman. The neat workers' quarters, company stores, and cultural centers depicted an idyllic scene of industrial contentment. Within a few months, the great Pullman labor strike would mar the picture, permanently associating the town with class violence instead of harmony. But labor discontent, like farmers' revolts, had no place at Chicago. At the fair, Pullman was the promise of the future.Other transportation exhibits heralded America's new world-wide role. Pneumatic conveyors promised to revolutionize retailing by eliminating bottlenecks in the distribution of goods. Elevators effortlessly transported people and goods. A model of a canal across Nicaragua showed how modern technology might bisect Central America and stimulate American trade with Asia. The International Navigation Company erected a full-size section of an ocean steamer, showing the numerous decks and the different classes of staterooms and dining rooms. Twenty thousand people a day visited this lavishly outfitted "ship," absorbing the idea that comfort and luxury were now the rule in ocean travel. The day of the American tourist traversing the globe was still in its infancy, but the crowds at Chicago indicated tourism's potential.The vehicle exhibit lacked steam-, electric-, or petroleum-driven carriages, but future trends were evident all the same. American carriages were lighter and cheaper than European models. Unlike their competitors, they were, in the words of one commentator, made by "modern machinery and the systematic methods of large manufactories." They contrasted with the fine British coaches, which, the same American commentator noted, were "interesting on account of their style, long since out of fashion." Even before the automobile age, advanced technology and mass appeal distinguished America's transportation industry.Machinery Hall also emphasized technological wizardry. There, the White City's massive power plant, run by Westinghouse's huge engine-dynamo units, generated electrical power in quantities never before produced. Oil, rather than coal, was used for fuel, and Standard Oil built a forty-mile experimental pipeline that carried the fuel into the fair. Fifteen electric motors distributed the electricity throughout the fairgrounds, clearly demonstrating advanced techniques of power transmission. Half this power flowed to the most amazing exhibit of all--Westinghouse's incandescent lighting system. Illuminating the entire fairgrounds and its buildings, this system constituted the largest central power station in the United States. Not to be outdone, General Electric erected a ten-foot, 6,000-pound searchlight--the largest in the world--and powered the Edison Tower of Light, a seventy-eight-foot shaft glowing with thousands of colored flashing lights. Chicago's fair awesomely demonstrated the new electrical age.At Electricity Hall, power set in motion a mechanical world that seemed as marvelous in 1893 as it would seem commonplace in 1945. Most visitors got their first look at electric trolleys, long-distance phones, and electrical heaters. Edison's new kinetograph, in conjunction with a phonograph, visually reproduced an orator's movements and then synchronized these movements with the sound of his voice. G.E.'s elevated electric railroad safely speeded the huge crowds around the grounds. Other machinery exhibits highlighted Americans' talent for substituting technology for labor. All the fair's restaurants used dishwashing machines, and there were laundry and pressing machines, soapmaking machines, steamrollers, automatic sprinklers, street cleaners, and a machine that quickly weighed and bagged several tons of ground coffee a day. American sewing-machine companies such as Singer displayed improved versions of the home sewing machine. The <i>Daily Columbian,</i> a special World's Fair newspaper, spun off the latest steam-powered presses at the rate of eight hundred copies a minute. For one souvenir issue, workers placed pulp in a machine to make paper, composed the text on a linotype, printed, and distributed a finished newspaper--all in sixty-three minutes.Most startling in their diversity were the special machines for making boots and shoes. An expert operator using an improved sewing machine could sew nine hundred pairs of shoes a day; a "rivet and stud" machine inserted ninety rivets and studs per minute; a heeling machine drove three hundred nails per minute; a "burnishing and bottom-polishing and uppercleaning" machine finished the shoe for market. In all, more than a score of different processes contributed to making a single shoe.In contrast to the fair's technological originality, its artistic styles were imitative and familiar. Ironically, exposition planners, who defined art as the statuary and painting of an elite European tradition, refused to give a place to one of America's most successful and unique "artistic" creations: Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. But encamped outside the gates and across the street from the White City, the show attracted huge, enthusiastic crowds. An early yet fully developed expression of America's mass culture, Buffalo Bill's extravaganza became one of the Dream City's most popular exhibits. In Chicago, Americans flaunted the cheap mass products,the dazzling technology, and the alluring mass culture that, in the coming century, they would spread throughout the world.<b>THE IDEOLOGY OF LIBERAL-DEVELOPMENTALISM</b>This American dream of high technology and mass consumption was both promoted and accompanied by an ideology1 that I shall call liberal-developmentalism. Reflected in partial form by some of the 3,817 lecturers who spoke in 1893 at the World Congress Auxiliary to the Columbian Exposition, this ideology matured during the twentieth century. Liberal-developmentalism merged nineteenth-century liberal tenets with the historical experience of America's own development, elevating the beliefs and experiences of America's unique historical time and circumstance into developmental laws thought to be applicable everywhere.The ideology of liberal-developmentalism can be broken into five major features: (1) belief that other nations could and should replicate America's own developmental experience; (2) faith in private free enterprise; (3) support for free or open access for trade and investment; (4) promotion of free flow of information and culture; and (5) growing acceptance of governmental activity to protect private enterprise and to stimulate and regulate American participation in international economi...</p><h2>All Politics Is Local: Why Progressives Must Fight for the States</h2><p><b>Democrats have largely ceded control of state governments to the GOP, allowing them to rig our political system and undermine democracy itself.</b><br>After the 2016 election, Republicans had their largest majority in the states since 1928, controlling legislative chambers in thirty-two states and governor offices in thirty-three.

After a horrific leg injury left him an invalid, the educated, inquisitive, perceptive, and exceptionally witty 12-year-old began keeping a diary in 1860--just as secession and the Civil War began tearing the country and his world apart. He continued to write even as his health deteriorated until both the war and his life ended in 1865. His unique manuscript of the demise of the Old South&#x2014;lauded by the Library of Congress as one of its premier holdings&#x2014;is published here for the first time in The War Outside My Window: The Civil War Diary of LeRoy Wiley Gresham, 1860-1865.<br><br>LeRoy read books, devoured newspapers and magazines, listened to gossip, and discussed and debated important social and military issues with his parents and others. He wrote daily for five years, putting pen to paper with a vim and tongue-in-cheek vigor that impresses even now, more than 150 years later. His practical, philosophical, and occasionally Twain-like hilarious observations cover politics and the secession movement, the long and increasingly destructive Civil War, family pets, a wide variety of hobbies and interests, and what life was like at the center of a socially prominent wealthy family in the important Confederate manufacturing center of Macon. The young scribe often voiced concern about the family&#x2019;s pair of plantations outside town, and recorded his interactions and relationships with &#x201c;servants&#x201d; Howard, Allen, Eveline, and others as he pondered the fate of human bondage and his family&#x2019;s declining fortunes.<br><br>Unbeknownst to LeRoy, he was chronicling his own slow and painful descent toward death in tandem with the demise of the Southern Confederacy. He recorded&#x2014;often in horrific detail&#x2014;an increasingly painful and debilitating disease that robbed him of his childhood. The teenager&#x2019;s declining health is a consistent thread coursing through his fascinating journals. &#x201c;I feel more discouraged [and] less hopeful about getting well than I ever did before,&#x201d; he wrote on March 17, 1863. &#x201c;I am weaker and more helpless than I ever was.&#x201d; Morphine and a score of other &#x201c;remedies&#x201d; did little to ease his suffering. Abscesses developed; nagging coughs and pain consumed him. Alternating between bouts of euphoria and despondency, he often wrote, &#x201c;Saw off my leg.&#x201d;<br><br>The War Outside My Window, edited and annotated by Janet Croon with helpful footnotes and a detailed family biographical chart, captures the spirit and the character of a young privileged white teenager witnessing the demise of his world even as his own body slowly failed him. Just as Anne Frank has come down to us as the adolescent voice of World War II, LeRoy Gresham will now be remembered as the young voice of the Civil War South.</p><p>Janet E. Croon holds a Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree in Political Science, Modern European History, and Russian Language and Area Studies from the Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1983), and a Master&#x2019;s Degree in International Studies from the Univ. of Dayton (1985). She taught International Baccalaureate History for nearly two decades for Fairfax County Public Schools and developed a deep interest in the Civil War by living in northern Virginia. She is also the author of The War Outside My Window: The Civil War Diary of LeRoy Wiley Gresham, 1860-1865: A Comprehensive Curriculum Guide for Teachers (with Kimberly Conrad).&#x201c;The War Outside My Window is a remarkable diary that illuminates important aspects of mid-19th-century American life. Kept by a Georgia teenager coping with a fatal disease, it affords modern readers the best record I have encountered of the daily suffering and treatment of a terminally ill person during the Civil War era. Beyond the rich evidence relating to LeRoy Wiley Gresham&#x2019;s illness and Victorian medicine, it includes a bountiful array of observations about military, political, and social elements of the Civil War as witnessed from the Confederate home front. Alternately instructive, moving, and disturbing, this diary deserves a wide audience.&#x201d; (Gary W. Gallagher, Nau Professor of History, University of Virginia)<br><br>&#x201c;The War Outside My Window is really a window looking into the thoughts and perceptions of a doomed teenager who watched the Confederacy die even as he was dying himself. Intimate, observant, thoughtful, often amusing, his diary offers a heartrending portrait of courage and resilience by a young man robbed of his youth, one personal tragedy amid the decline and collapse of the South. Pitiably few records survive to give us an understanding of the inner world of the young in the Civil War era. LeRoy Gresham&#x2019;s &#x201c;Window&#x201d; lets in more light on the subject than any other source we have.&#x201d; (William C. Davis, author of Inventing Loreta Velasquez)<br><br>&#x201c;As The War Outside My Window aptly demonstrates, LeRoy Wiley Gresham was a fascinating young man possessed of wit, insight, and eloquence, all while suffering from the ravages of a terminal disease. His diary (published here for the first time) is simultaneously fascinating, insightful, compelling, and tragic. Anyone interested in the home front in the South during the Civil War, slavery, family, and the travails of doomed youth will find this book a real treasure. It deserves a wide audience well beyond the Civil War community, and a place on your bookshelf. Kudos to Savas Beatie and editor Janet Croon for bringing this story to life.&#x201d; (Eric J. Wittenberg, award-winning Civil War historian)<br><br>&#x201c;In The War Outside My Window, an articulate Southern teenager records his observations on military, political, and social events as they unfold, mostly outside the sphere of his confinement in Macon, Georgia, as the Union juggernaut slowly devours the resources of the Confederacy. But windows go both ways, and this unique diary also grants readers unprecedented access into a parallel internal battle being waged by a spunky youth whose comfort, vigor, and life itself are being devoured by the fatal medical scourge of the nineteenth century. This poignant account of LeRoy&#x2019;s courageous, but ultimately unsuccessful personal struggle is certain to grip your heart. Civil War students and medical historians alike will find a rich and rare trove of primary source material in this unique five-year chronicle.&#x201d; (Dennis A. Rasbach, MD, FACS, author of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the Petersburg Campaign)<br><br>&#x201c;The War Outside My Window offers a powerful, entertaining, and insightful glimpse into the world of the Civil War from an unlikely author. Twelve years old and suffering from a severe leg injury when the war began, LeRoy Gresham took to his diary to explore the turbulent world around him in a candid and often humorous manner. Covering serious topics such as slavery and politics as well as the more light-hearted concerns of a young boy, Gresham&#x2019;s account reminds us that the war touched those far removed from the battlefield even as the more routine aspects of life continued. While the war raged beyond Gresham&#x2019;s window, this never-before published diary is itself a rare window into the Civil War home front.&#x201d; (Caroline E. Janney, author of Remembering the Civil War: Reunion and the Limits of Reconciliation)<br><br>&#x201c;The volume gains poignancy from Gresham&#x2019;s incomplete final writing... likely to be of most interest to historians or serious students of the period.&#x201d; (Hannah Kushnick <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;...a fascinating picture from the eyes of a young man as the South slowly changes during the course of the war, from the heady early days to the slow realization that the South was going to lose. While LeRoy Gresham might not have been directly involved in the politics of the town, he kept up on the ever-shifting news and often provides his own opinions... a fascinating look into civilian life.&#x201d; (<i>Tulsa Book Review</i>)<br><br>"The publication of this edited and annotated source has made an absorbing account of the Civil War South from the perspective of a privileged but afflicted youth available and accessible to a broad audience." (Anya Jabour, Regents Professor of History at the University of Montana)<br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating record. It is a sign of Croon&#x2019;s accomplishment as an editor that . . . the reader really does not care all that much about the larger world of the ill-fated Confederacy, so completely does this diary take us into the pathos and pity of a more private world that really blots out the war outside its window.&#x201d; (Social History of Medicine)</p><h2>It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History</h2><p><p><i><b>A history of heartbreak-replete with beheadings, uprisings, creepy sex dolls, and celebrity gossip-and its disastrously bad consequences throughout time</b></i></p><p>Spanning eras and cultures from ancient Rome to medieval England to 1950s Hollywood, Jennifer Wright's <i>It Ended Badly</i> guides you through the worst of the worst in historically bad breakups. In the throes of heartbreak, Emperor Nero had just about everyone he ever loved-from his old tutor to most of his friends-put to death. Oscar Wilde's lover, <i>whom he went to jail for</i>, abandoned him when faced with being cut off financially from his wealthy family and wrote several self-serving books denying the entire affair. And poor volatile Caroline Lamb sent Lord Byron one hell of a torch letter and enclosed a bloody lock of her own pubic hair. Your obsessive social media stalking of your ex isn't looking so bad now, is it?</p><p>With a wry wit and considerable empathy, Wright digs deep into the archives to bring these thirteen terrible breakups to life. She educates, entertains, and really puts your own bad breakup conduct into perspective. <i>It Ended Badly</i> is for anyone who's ever loved and lost and maybe sent one too many ill-considered late-night emails to their ex, reminding us that no matter how badly we've behaved, no one is as bad as Henry VIII.</p></p><p><b>Jennifer Wright</b> is a columnist for the <i>New York Observer</i> and the <i>New York Post</i>, covering sex and dating.

His walls are lined with books like <i>Out in the Silver West</i>, <i>The Boys' Book of Pirates</i>, and <i>Executive Opportunities</i>, which provide fodder for his ruminations on career change. Encouraged by his wife, who is also eager to incorporate more adventure into her life, Jim sets out to bring these dreams to fruition by accumulating various accoutrements, only to discover that the life of an executive, an artist, or a cowboy is more complicated and costly than it appears.</p><br><p>Jim's childlike understanding of the world that surrounds him is enhanced by Raymond Briggs's subtle and inventive illustrations. Fantasies are portrayed as organic clouds that move between and overlap outlined panels of his reality, and myopic Jim is drawn smaller and softer than the policemen and bureaucrats interested in impeding his search for adventure. As he begins to infringe more seriously on the law, the city workers and their speech boxes become increasingly angular, much like the rigid rules and regulations restricting his sincere quest. With this playful style, Briggs expertly transforms common feelings of inadequacy into an endearing and enjoyable experience that speaks across generations, concluding with an optimistic implication that even a misfortunate outcome can be better than no change at all.</p><p>This classic novel, originally published in 1980, is presented by Drawn &amp; Quarterly in a new edition.</p></p><p>International bestselling cartoonist/illustrator <b>Raymond Briggs</b> has been writing and drawing children's books and graphic novels for more than forty years, including his best-loved books <i>Father Christmas </i>and <i>The Snowman</i>. An early pioneer of literary graphic novels with his brilliant satire on nuclear war, <i>When the Wind Blo</i>ws (1982), he is also well known in North America for his poignant depiction of the lives of his parents in <i>Ethel &amp; Ernest</i>.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;Jim Bloggs is a middle-aged toilet cleaner who dreams of a life filled with adventure. Influenced by his nightly reading of children's storybooks, he imagines himself as a pirate, a cowboy, and even a successful Renaissance painter&#x2014;anything to help break the monotony of his daily life. While the storybook-inspired illustrations appear simple, Briggs makes skillful use of every element on the page; from layouts to the look of text boxes, everything functions to match and enhance the moods and themes of the tale. Jim's imagination is little more than a quaint eccentricity until it starts to bleed into his real life. His desire to become a highwayman prompts him to wear a dramatic cape and toy sword; he finally comes to the attention of the authorities when he illegally buys a donkey for a valiant steed and rides it around the city, looking for excitement. But his charming, childlike innocence wins in the end; when confronted with circumstances that could have been very sad, Jim's fertile mind manages to turn it into another triumph. This edition of a 1980 work includes an introduction by cartoonist Seth that explains how influential Briggs has been over the years. While the innocent-looking art might turn off readers looking for an edgier story, anyone picking up this title will be treated to a sweet, whimsical tale.&#x2014;<i>Matthew L.

A defiant, scantily clad Jane Russell standing near the hay. Bogart, Garfield, Kirk Douglas, Judy Garland.

Now the translation of the eminent classicist C. D. Yonge is available in an affordable, easy-to-read edition, with a new foreword and newly translated passages, and containing supposed fragments of Philo's writings from ancient authors such as John of Damascus. The title and arrangement of the writings have been standardized according to scholarly conventions.</p><p>A contemporary of Paul and Jesus, Philo Judaeus, of Alexandria, Egypt, is unquestionably among the most important writers for historians and students of Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity. Although Philo does not explicitly mention Jesus, or Paul, or any of the followers of Jesus, Philo lived in their world. It is from Philo, for example, that we learn about how, like the Gospel of John, Jews (and Greeks) in the Greco-Roman world spoke of the creative force of God as God's "Logos." Philo, too, employs interpretive strategies that parallel those of the author of Hebrews. Most scholars would agree that Philo and the author of Hebrews are drawing from the same, or at least similar, traditions of Hellenistic Judaism. With these kind of connections to the world of Judaism and early Christianity, Philo cannot be ignored.</p></p><p><p>C. D. Yonge (1812-1892), a noted classicist and author of more than thirty-five works, studied classics at St. Mary Hall, Oxford. A professor of modern history and English literature at Queen's College, Belfast, from 1866 until the time of his death, Yonge also compiled a Greek-English lexicon. The present translation of the works of Philo first appeared in 1854-1855 in 4 volumes in Bohn's Ecclesiastical Library.</p></p><h2>A Packet of Surprises: The Best Essays and Sermons of F. W. Boreham</h2><p>Choosing the best essays of F. W. Boreham is as excruciating as selecting some children to get the honors and telling the others that they did not make the grade. As mentioned in the preface to "All the Blessings of Life: The Best Stories of F. W. Boreham (Revised)" the selection is subjective. But there is some rhyme and reason to the choices. Some were voted in by current Boreham readers so they appear by popular demand. Others are clearly Boreham's choice or were popular in his day. In compiling this selection an effort has been made to include essays on a range of themes, those which illustrate different homiletical methods and others that are drawn from different periods in Boreham's career. The sermon "The Whisper of God" may at face value have not made the cut in Boreham's best but it is included because it is the best of his earliest sermons and it illustrates how his preaching changed in style, structure and length. "The Best Essays and Sermons of F. W. Boreham" demonstrate the way that Boreham worked hard to remodel his writing and preaching through such things as the removal of wordy clutter, for it is clear to see the emergence of a simple and flowing style. These essays and sermons have been brought together not for literary inspection and homiletical interest but so they might speak powerfully to readers in this contemporary age. The great hope for this new book is that it might stimulate among its readers one of the major themes of F. W. Boreham -- that each person, with their God-given gifts might develop their unique style (Dr. Geoff Pound). This book also includes: a profile of Boreham written by T. Howard Crago, name and topical indexes and an "About the Cover" section. Twenty six pages of introductory material are followed by 298 pages. Please consider checking out the other titles published by John Broadbanks Publishing<p>A portion of the sale of each book will go toward the training of pastors and missionaries at Whitley College, a ministry that Boreham supported during his lifetime.</p></p><p>Packet makes me think of a package of seeds. You sow a seed, but what springs up looks much different. The difference between the body of the seed and the body of the plant is somewhat of a surprise. I still remember my pleasant surprise at reading Boreham for the first time. My heart was strangely warmed as I read through Thomas Chalmers Text in Life Verses Volume One. Here was a writer that combined so many elements that move me deeply: story, history, illustration, poetry, beauty, quotations and more. I had forgotten how much I liked wonder-filled literature, and reading the lovely story of Thomas Chalmers woke me from slumber. It felt like a new day. I devoured the rest of the book and series. What a surprise to find such treasure in the writings of a man, who but for the frequent mentions of his name by Ravi Zacharias, might be mostly forgotten. I&#39;m so glad for the image of the flower that has yet to unfold its petals. The glory of its blossom is about to be revealed. What it will be is not yet fully known. It beautifully conveys the surprise and wonder that I hope every reader finds in these essays and sermons. May Boreham&#39;s thoughts, like seeds, take root and grow in our hearts so that the beauty of the flower brings glory to its Maker (Michael Dalton).</p><h2>April Blood: Florence and the Plot against the Medici</h2><p>One of the world&#39;s leading historians of Renaissance Italy brings to life here the vibrant-and violent-society of fifteenth-century Florence. His disturbing narrative opens up an entire culture, revealing the dark side of Renaissance man and politician Lorenzo de&#39; Medici. On a Sunday in April 1478, assassins attacked Lorenzo and his brother as they attended Mass in the cathedral of Florence. Lorenzo scrambled to safety as Giuliano bled to death on the cathedral floor. April Blood moves outward in time and space from that murderous event, unfolding a story of tangled passions, ambition, treachery, and revenge. The conspiracy was led by one of the city&#39;s most noble clans, the Pazzi, financiers who feared and resented the Medici&#39;s swaggering new role as political bosses-but the web of intrigue spread through all of Italy. Bankers, mercenaries, the Duke of Urbino, the King of Naples, and Pope Sixtus IV entered secretly into the plot. Florence was plunged into a peninsular war, and Lorenzo was soon fighting for his own and his family&#39;s survival. The failed assassination doomed the Pazzi. Medici revenge was swift and brutal-plotters were hanged or beheaded, innocents were hacked to pieces, and bodies were put out to dangle from the windows of the government palace. All remaining members of the larger Pazzi clan were forced to change their surname, and every public sign or symbol of the family was expunged or destroyed. April Blood offers us a fresh portrait of Renaissance Florence, where dazzling artistic achievements went side by side with violence, craft, and bare-knuckle politics. At the center of the canvas is the figure of Lorenzo the Magnificent-poet, statesman, connoisseur, patron of the arts, and ruthless &#34;boss of bosses&#34;. This extraordinarily vivid account of a turning point in the Italian Renaissance is bound to become a lasting work of history.</p><p><br><strong>Lauro Martines</strong>, former Professor of European History at the University of California, Los Angeles, is renowned for his books on the Italian Renaissance.

Lauro Martines has come up with a wealth of new material and has produced a rivetting book."--John Julius Norwich, author of <em>A History of Venice</em> and <em>Byzantium</em><p></p><br>"In retelling the story of the Pazzi conspiracy, Lauro Martines has gone back to that Florentine world he first explored a half-century ago. He has written the most comprehensive account to date of that blood-drenched affair, describing the motivations of the conspirators, the role of contingency in the botched implementation of the plot, and the ferocity of the Mediceans in their reprisals against the Pazzi and their allies. He uses the conspiracy to identify characteristic features of the political, social, and cultural environment of late Quattrocento Italy, most notably, the networks that linked together Italian elites. His vivid account underscores a point made long ago by Jacob Burckhardt: for the upper echelons of Italian society, their patria was a very dangerous place."--Gene Brucker, Professor Emeritus, University of California Berkeley, author of <em>Renaissance Florence</em> and <em>Florence: The Golden Age</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Found Object in Textile Art: Recycling And Repurposing Natural, Printed And Vintage Objects</h2><p><b>One of the world&#x2019;s leading textile artists provides inspiration and techniques for incorporating found objects into your work.&nbsp; </b><br><br> Cas Holmes is renowned for her use of the found object, and her many-layered, atmospheric pieces have been exhibited internationally.

See how to do mark-making with nontraditional coloring media such as beetroot; knead paper, in a process known as <i>momigami</i>; stitch fabric to form three-dimensional shapes; turn mundane items like bottle caps into brooches; and add meaning to your art by incorporating personal memorabilia. Suggested projects range from simple journals to unusual frames, and you&#x2019;ll find a wealth of techniques and inspiration, all illustrated with examples from the world&#x2019;s best textile art.</p><p>Cas Holmes is one of the UK's most renowned textile artists. She exhibits widely and runs courses at West Dean College. She has written for magazines including <i>The Quilter</i>, and has contributed to Workshop on the Web. She lives in Maidstone, Kent.It is not exactly a how-to but a wonderful European way of describing the art of the lost&#x2014;and found again. For British artist Holmes, being green is a by-product of her textile (and paper) art; almost any object, found anywhere, is cause for celebration&#x2014;and inspiration. This very contemporary re-use of materials takes a little getting used to. Plus, the author, determined to persuade novices to do it themselves, includes very few detailed instructions; rather, she simply lists combinations of surfaces and the use of different tools and methods without specific suggestions. The section on joining layers, for instance, features commercial wallpaper paste as well as later references to hand and machine stitching. To a crafter&#x2019;s delight, new terms and techniques are explored in some depth; momigami, the Japanese form of kneaded paper, contains streamlined instructions, as do sun printing, low-tech image transfer, and decoupage. Each page is colored with inspiring images, such as &#x201c;Candy Colours&#x201d; or plastic sherbet straws, just enough to whet any would-be artist&#x2019;s appetite. Charmingly idiosyncratic. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>This Heart of Mine</h2><p><p><em>New York Times </em>bestselling author&nbsp;Susan Elizabeth Phillips magic is vibrantly alive, and it's on display in <em>This Heart of Mine,</em> the fifth book in her wildly popular Chicago Stars series!</p><p>Molly Somerville loves her career as the creator of the Daphne the Bunny children's book series, but the rest of her life could use some improvement.

Unfortunately, Kevin doesn't know she's alive until one fateful weekend when they're marooned together at the family vacation cabin. When Molly gets carried away by her creative imagination and compromises Kevin, the results are disastrous and before the dust settles, Kevin's in trouble with his boss, Molly's in deep trouble with her emotions, and both of them are in danger of losing their hearts. Their journey to a happy ending is dicey, at best, and even if they can get past their outrageous and painful beginning, whether these two can lower their guards and let the other into their equally wary hearts is questionable.<p> Bestselling author Susan Elizabeth Phillips makes her hardcover debut with this wonderful contemporary tale that features two familiar faces from prior novels as the hero and heroine. The characters are complicated, with difficult pasts that have shaped the adults they now are, and Phillips uses a deft touch in sketching their personal growth as they're tested with tragedy and bound together with love and a healthy dose of humor. As always, Phillips brings her delightful wit and a warm family setting to this novel that is sure to captivate readers. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p><p>Molly Somerville loves her career as the creator of the Daphne the Bunny children's book series, but the rest of her life could use some improvement.

Look to the Mediterranean for innovative, fresh, and nutritious ideas. In <strong>Against the Grain</strong>, award-winning cookbook author <strong>Diane Kochilas</strong> offers up a collection of satisfying, good-for-you recipes inspired by the exotic dishes of the Mediterranean.</p><p>Whether you're trying to lose weight or simply improve you're eating habits, sticking to a good carb diet is a great idea. The Mediterranean diet isn't all breads, grains, and pasta -- it includes plenty of fish, chicken, lamb, vegetables, and fruits. <strong>Against the Grain</strong> includes recipes for everything from light bites, such as tapas, soups, and salads, to hearty entrees and sides. The ingredient lists are supermarket-friendly and prep time is minimal, so busy home cooks can whip up healthy meals in minutes, every night of the week.</p><p>In addition to classics like Fresh Tomato Soup with Moroccan Spices, Chicken Cacciatore, and Pan-Seared Shrimp with Romesco Sauce, there are innovative, exotic new dishes like Grilled Skewered Lamb with Mint and Garlic Pesto, Pork Medallions Marinated with Olives and Orange, and Roasted Red Pepper and Feta Souffl�.</p><p>One of the basic principles of the Mediterranean lifestyle is that everything should be enjoyed in moderation. In <strong>Against the Grain</strong>, no foods are forbidden or totally off limits. Instead, you'll find formerly "sinful" ingredients like rich cheeses, potatoes, rice, fragrant nuts and oils, and wine incorporated into savory meals. Yes, the recipes are healthy and nutritious, but, more important, the dishes in Against the Grain are hearty, satisfying, and flavorful.</p></p><p><p>The author of five cookbooks, including <em>Meze</em> and the IACP Award-winning <em>The Glorious Foods of Greece</em>, Diane Kochilas writes for <em>Saveur</em>, <em>Gourmet</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em>; runs the Glorious Greek Kitchen Cooking School on the Greek island of Ikaria; is the consulting chef at Pylos, an acclaimed Greek restaurant in New York City; and is the food columnist and restaurant critic for <em>Ta Nea</em>, the largest-circulation daily newspaper in Greece. She divides her time between New York City, Athens, and Ikaria.</p>By combining weight-loss tenets of the South Beach Diet with the touted health benefits of the Mediterranean way of eating, Kochilas (<i>Meze</i>; <i>The Glorious Foods of Greece</i>) brings flavorful, nourishing, low-calorie foods to the dieter's home kitchen. The success of the collection's dishes lies in the use of whole grains rather than processed white flour, copious use of vegetables and a sensible "nothing-in-excess" approach. Kochilas advocates easygoing meals made with fresh, seasonal and organic ingredients, and encourages use of herbs and spices to add flavor without calories. She recommends generous use of heart-friendly and delicious olive oil, the "liquid gold" of the Mediterranean. Home cooks will easily master Kochilas's easy, precise recipes, which include Asparagus, Basil, and Tomato Frittata; Roasted Red Pepper Hummus; Balsamic-Honey Glazed Chicken Breasts; and Spicy Lamb Kebabs. Her combination of good-carb dieting with the richness of the Mediterranean table is bound to bring some much needed joie de vivre to low-carb dining. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the celebration is short-lived-a long battle ensues. Moshe Sachar, a professor and strategist for the Haganah group, must keep the movement's momentum alive in the face of a dissenting mayor and a disguised SS assassin who has infiltrated the group. Meanwhile, Rachel, his pregnant wife, tends to the growing numbers of wounded at the hospital.<br><br> Bodie and Brock Thoene bring to life the stories of a striking cast of characters in an epic story of heroism, tragedy, romance, and faith set against a momentous turning point in the history of the world's most sacred city.</p><p>May 19, 1948. The state of Israel is five days old. The city of Jerusalem is tenuously poised for a clash that will be critical in the life of the new country. Holding the keys to an Israeli victory is a diverse, rag-tag group: Peter Wallich, once a teacher of agriculture in the kibbutz, now instructing teens in the assembly of Molotov cocktails; the 74-year-old mother superior, who desperately wants to preserve her convent from annihilation; Commander Moshe Sachar and his wife Rachel, who cling together amidst the horrors of war; and an Arab street urchin, Daoud, who repays the kindness of the so-called infidels in the best way he knows how. Interspersed throughout is the appearance of a mysterious old gardener, with wounds on the palms of both hands.<p> In the Zion Legacy series, the Thoenes return to a cast of characters and themes from their bestselling Zion Chronicles series that earned them a sterling reputation and a faithful readership in the Christian fiction arena. This second installment, <i>Thunder from Jerusalem</i>, starts slowly as the characters are reintroduced, and the stage is set. Then, the pace accelerates. The lives of Muslims, Jews, and Catholics all intersect in a tale of romance and suffering, patriotism and betrayal. Here is solid historical research paired with dramatic storytelling, a combination that has won Bodie and Brock Thoene eight Gold Medallion Awards. </p><p> Those who enjoyed the bestselling <i>Jerusalem Vigil</i>, the first book in the Zion Legacy series, won't want to miss this latest offering from the pens of the popular Thoenes. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p><b>Bodie</b> and <b>Brock Thoene</b>, with degrees in creative writing and history, respectively, are the authors of <b>Jerusalem Vigil</b> and <b>Thunder from Jerusalem</b>, the first two volumes of the <b>Zion Legacy</b> series.

Yet his most ambitious scholarly achievement, his three-volume study of Rabbinic Judaism, is only now appearing in English. Heschel's great insight is that the world of rabbinic thought can be divided into two types or schools, those of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael, and that the historic disputes between the two are based on fundamental differences over the nature of revelation and religion. Furthermore, this disagreement constitutes a basic and necessary ongoing polarity within Judaism between immanence and transcendence, mysticism and rationalism, neo-Platonism and Aristotelianism. Heschel then goes on to show how these two fundamental theologies of revelation may be used to interpret a great number of topics central to Judaism.</p></p><p>Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) was a preeminent scholar, acclaimed spiritual writer, and prophetic activist. He was a professor of ethics and mysticism at Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City.Gordon Tucker is senior rabbi of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, NY, and adjunct assistant professor of Jewish philosophy at Jewish Theological Center, New York. He is the editor and translator of &#34;Heavenly Torah as Refracted through the Generations&#34; by Abraham Joshua Heschel.&#x201c;Like Copernicus ... Heschel has set the world on its head ... Without actually examining the evidence, one can hardly be aware of how intrinsically valid is Heschel&#x2019;s hermeneutic principle. Without seeing how thorough and well-disciplined has been his study of Talmudic literature, one cannot fully appreciate his achievement in bringing some order and sense to it ... This is clearly a work of gigantic proportions.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jacob Neusner (Jacob Neusner)<br><br>&#x201c;...one of the most important books in Jewish Studies.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jewish Herald-Voice, November 25, 2004<br><br>&#x201c;This is an ambitious work of tremendous significance, and indispensable guide to understanding the Torah and- consequently- the Jewish religion. Not simply for large religious collections, but for any with active borrowers.&#x201d; &#x2013;Booklist, November 15, 2004<br><br>&#x201c;Heschel&#x2019;s most important, ambitious, and monumental work....this translation will best serve academics who do not have complete or even partial control of Hebrew, it is accessible enough for any lay reader interested in Jewish theology. A tour de force of gigantic proportions; recommended for all libraries.&#x201d; &#x2013;Library Journal, 1/28/05<br><br>&#x201c;The publication of this book, the fruit of over a decade of work, and coinciding with the 100th anniversary of Heschel&#x2019;s birth (1905), and his 32nd yahrzeit, is an event!...far more than a simple translation.... Only on the inside title page do we discover the names of the editors and translators. This act of generosity on the part of Rabbis Tucker and Levin must be acknowledged. But of course, this is entirely Heschel&#x2019;s book, and that is cause enough for radical amazement.&#x201d; &#x2013;Sh&#x2019;ma, January 2005<br><br>&#x201c;...it reveals Heschel&#x2019;s rarely equaled mastery of the entire body of rabbinic, philosophical and mystical literature, both the original sources and the secondary literature.... In his tragically brief lifetime, Heschel represented many role models. He was the hero of modern Jewish theologians, the father of the new Jewish spirituality and the eloquent spokesperson for all who were devoted to repairing our seriously flawed world. These two &#x2018;new&#x2019; books speak to his enduring contributions in all of these areas.&#x201d; &#x2013;The Jewish Week, 12/24/04<br><br>&#x201c;Gordon Tucker (and Leonard Levin) have done a superb job of assembling, editing, abridging and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript. Others literally died trying to translate this sprawling masterpiece....on the whole, the introductions to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page (including identifying Heschel&#x2019;s often obscure sources) are wonderful aids in working through this massive work. Here, now, the greatest Jewish thinker in American history, the true inheritor of Polish Hasidism and German Jewish scholarship, the friend of Martin Luther King and the Pope, our master and teacher, Abraham Joshua Heschel, becomes at last, the major interpreter of classical Judaism. May God, who makes all things possible, be blessed.&#x201d; &#x2013;Judaism, forthcoming in 2005<br><br>&#x201c;The present translation for the original Hebrew is a fine English edition of Heschel&#x2019;s most substantive contribution to the study of early rabbinic literature, with very helpful notes added by the translator. All libraries serving Judaica and religion programs will want to purchase this volume. Highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2013;Choice, July 2005 (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Citing patterns that underlay the rabbinical passages, the text of Heavenly Torah uncovers the intellectual and spiritual riches of the Talmudic tradition and applies those teachings to the concerns of the modern age. Heavenly Torah is thus a major addition to the library of Religious Humanism in our time. Masterfully brought to the marketplace in a beautiful edition by Continuum Books, who were also responsible for publishing Jonathan Sacks&#x2019; masterpiece The Dignity of Difference, and translated by Gordon Tucker with precision and tremendous knowledge and skill, Heavenly Torah is a seminal addition to our library of Jewish studies.... The English version of the book makes completely transparent the intent and intellectual context of the original-a matter that has been simplified not merely by the clear translation of the texts, citations and footnotes, but by the addition layer of Tucker&#x2019;s own footnotes and illuminating chapter introductions that make Heschel&#x2019;s aims wholly clear to the reader-a matter that is sometimes hard to fully grasp with the dense opacity of the Hebrew original....the English version of the book functions not merely as a brilliantly articulated interweaving of rabbinical texts and ideas, but serves as a general introduction-presented with great clarity and crystalline intelligibility-for the reader who is beginning to learn rabbinical texts.&#x201d; &#x2013;Center for Sephardic Heritage, 4/6/05<br><br>&#x201c;brilliantly translated...a superb job of assembling, abridging, and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript...the introduction to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page are wonderful aids in working through this massive work.&#x201d; &#x2013;Current Theological Writing (Current Theological Writing)</p><h2>Dark Forces: The Truth About What Happened in Benghazi</h2><p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Shadow Warriors</em> investigates the tragedy of Benghazi to answer the questions: what really happened&#x2014;and why?</p><p>We know the Obama administration&#x2019;s story, of a demonstration caused by an Internet movie that went out of control. But what actually did happen in Benghazi on the night of September 11, 2012?</p><p><em>Dark Forces</em> is the story of clandestine arms deliveries by the United States and its allies to Libya that wound up in the hands of Islamist guerrillas. It&#x2019;s a story of a romantic diplomat, in love with the Middle East and with a mystical version of Islam. It&#x2019;s a story of bald-faced lies, heroic acts, and the deepest corruption.</p><p>But <em>Dark Forces</em> is not only a retelling of events. It puts those events into the larger context of Obama administration policy toward the Middle East. It will examine the administration&#x2019;s record of systematically supporting Muslim Brotherhood and extremist groups in their efforts to overthrow pro-U.S. autocrats in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.</p><p>It shows how President Obama&#x2019;s obsessive outreach to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran led the Iranian regime to dismiss him as a weak, ineffective leader who would not fight back. And it shows why and how this deadly combination cost the lives of four Americans on Sept. 11, 2012.</p></p><p><p>In this explosive expos�, bestselling author Kenneth Timmerman gives us the real story of what happened in Benghazi, and the lengths to which the Obama administration has gone to hide the truth from the American people.</p><p>Forget what you've heard: the September 11, 2012, attack on U.S. Government Compounds in Benghazi, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including our ambassador, was not a spontaneous demonstration. Nor was it planned by local militias.It was a state-sponsored terrorist attack with Iranian fingerprints all over it.</p><p>What's more, the Obama administration knew from the first minutes of the attack that the compound had been targeted by an organized, professionally trained terrorist group. But the administration made up a ridiculous cover story about a nonexistent demonstration over an Internet movie in an attempt to fool the American public on the eve of a national election. </p><p>The Iran-Contra scandal consumed Ronald Reagan's second term and nearly destroyed his presidency. Yet as bad as that was, what happened in Benghazi is much worse. As Ken Timmerman reveals in <em>Dark Forces</em>, the Benghazi affair will go down as the deepest, darkest, dirtiest political scandal of recent American history. And for all the coverage it has received, the real story has still not been told. </p><p>It's a story of clandestine arms deliveries to Libyan rebels that wound up in the hands of Islamist guerrillas allied with al Qaeda. It's a story of a romantic American diplomat who gets caught up in a whirlwind beyond his comprehension or control. It's a story of bald-faced lies, heroic acts, and the deepest corruption. </p><p><em>Dark Forces</em> is much more than a retelling of what happened in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. It puts those events into the larger context of the Obama administration's policy toward the Middle East&#x2014;from Iran to the Arab Spring. It examines the administration's record of systematically supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and al Qaeda&#x2013;affiliated groups in their efforts to overthrow pro-U.S. autocrats in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. It shows how this went along with the administration's outreach to the Islamist regime in Iran. It argues that President Obama's obsessive outreach to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran led the Iranian regime to dismiss him as a weak, ineffective leader who would not fight back when hit. And it reveals why and how this deadly combination cost the lives of four Americans, and today endangers thousands more.</p><p>Written with the breakneck pacing of a political thriller, and drawing on exclusive research and privileged sources, <em>Dark Forces</em> tells the full story of Benghazi as you have never heard it before. </p><p>Kenneth R.

Drawing on his own experiences in Chicago, and on his relationships with other mayors around America, Emanuel provides dozens of examples to show how cities are improving education, infrastructure, job conditions, and environmental policy at a local level.<br><br>Emanuel argues that cities are the most ancient political institutions, dating back thousands of years and have reemerged as the nation-states of our time. He makes clear how mayors are accountable to their voters to a greater degree than any other elected officials and illuminates how progressives and centrists alike can best accomplish their goals by focusing their energies on local politics. <i>The Nation City</i> maps out a new, energizing, and hopeful way forward.</p><p>RAHM EMANUEL was the forty-fourth mayor of Chicago, serving two terms from 2011-2019. He previously served as President Obama&#39;s chief of staff and as chairman of both the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Democratic Caucus. He is a contributor to ABC News and lives in Chicago.&#x201c;Rahm Emanuel is a unique leader who combines a deep understanding of policy with the political skills to get things done. In <i>The Nation City</i>, he offers a new blueprint for making a progressive vision a reality&#x2014;and shows why cities are increasingly America&#x2019;s laboratories of democracy.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;President Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States<br><br>"<i>The Nation City</i>&nbsp;surprised me&#x2060;&#x2014;and in a good way.

She is well known to the media.McTaggart, an investigative journalist (What Doctors Don't Tell You), describes scientific discoveries that she believes point to a unifying concept of the universe, one that reconciles mind with matter, classic Newtonian science with quantum physics and, most importantly, science with religion. At issue is the zero point field, the so-called "dead space" of microscopic vibrations in outer space as well as within and between physical objects on earth. These fields, McTaggart asserts, are a "cobweb of energy exchange" that link everything in the universe; they control everything from cellular communication to the workings of the mind, and they could be harnessed for unlimited propulsion fuel, levitation, ESP, spiritual healing and more. Physicists have been aware of the likelihood of this field for years, McTaggart writes, but, constrained by orthodoxy, they have ignored its effects, which she likens to "subtracting out God" from their equations. But, McTaggart asserts, "tiny pockets of quiet rebellion" against scientific convention are emerging, led by Ed Mitchell, an Apollo 14 astronaut and founder of the Institute for Noetic Sciences, an alternative-science think tank. McTaggart writes well and tells a good story, but the supporting data here is somewhat sketchy. Until it materializes, McTaggart may have to settle for being a voice in the wilderness.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Pictorial History of Our English Bible</h2><p>A Pictorial History of Our English Bible [Paperback] [Jan 01, 1982] Beale, David</p><p></p><h2>La Nausee (Folio) (French Edition)</h2><p><p>Nausea is the story of Antoine Roquentin, a French writer who is horrified at his own existence.

They share responsibility for the birth of a remarkable and radiant boy who embarks on a mandated quest that takes the reader all over Europe and to the land where all such quests begin and end. Abounding in philosophical, psychological and theological inquiries, yet laced with humor that is as infectious as it is willful, The Discovery of Heaven lingers in the mind long after it has been read. It not only tells an accessible story, but also convinces one that it just might be possible to bring order into the chaos of the world through a story.</p></p><p>Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch has created an epic tale of love, friendship, and divine intervention in this cerebral story of heavenly influence. On earth, the novel revolves around the friendship of a brilliant, charismatic astronomer and a talented linguist born on the same day. The two men also happen to share a lover, a woman of simple beauty who is a gifted cellist. These relationships, both intellectual and intimate, produce several intriguing conversations about science, art, and theology, and a child of uncertain paternity. The child&#39;s birth is closely followed by a number of mysterious accidents, spirited affairs, untimely deaths, and other acts that reveal the influence of higher powers. Quinten, the star-fated child, has a mission from on high to return the covenant God made with man before he was led astray by science and the dark influence of the devil. An engrossing, and at times comic, story of theology and science, angels, and earthly desires, is cleverly told in this hugely ambitious novel.Harry Mulisch is author of the international bestsellers <b>The Assault</b>, <b>The Discovery of Heaven</b>, and <b>The Procedure</b>, as well as other novels, short stories, essays, poetry, plays, and philosophical works.<br><p>Paul Vincent lives in London and translated Harry Mulisch's previous two novels.</p></p><h2>Moon Dance</h2><p>The bestselling suspense author shows her softer side in this endearing love story of two searching hearts. . . .<br> <br> Georgia Enright has dedicated her life to dance.

Though in top athletic form after nine years of dancing professionally, she still performed an exacting ritual before setting out on her daily run. Side-to-side stretches forward lunges, jumping jacks, leg lifts. Twenty of each. Her warm-up completed, she left her sixth-floor condo, locked the door securely behind her, tucked the key into the pocket of her dark green hooded sweatshirt, and set off for the ground floor. On foot.<br>Taking the stairs only prolonged her prerun warmup, she rationalized. It was good exercise, good for her heart, good for her lungs. Why ride when you can walk? And besides, elevators made her claustrophobic.<br>Georgia skipped through the lobby, but once outside the imposing front door of the building she had called home for the past five years, she broke into a measured trot and took to the pavement. At the corner, she turned onto Pratt Street and set a pace that would carry her to her destination within her allotted twenty minutes. Despite the day's valiant attempt to cultivate a sunny disposition, a late winter chill hung about Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Filling her lungs with air heavy with the faint, tangy scent of the sea, Georgia jogged briskly past lingering piles of dirty snow that huddled in the shaded areas around the Convention Center. Off to her far right beckoned Harborplace -- two glass-enclosed shopping malls that provided tourists and residents alike a shopping fix on a grand scale -- and the first of the piers that jutted smartly into the harbor. A little farther ahead would be the World Trade Center, and beyond, on Pier Three, the National Aquarium, field-trip mecca for elementary schools up and down the East Coast.<br>At the corner of Gay and Pratt, Georgia stopped for traffic, then crossed the street and proceeded straight up Gay as she began her cool-down pace, slowing slightly until she reached the small restaurant with the faded red-and-green awning. Several small, round tables for two had been set up out front with plaid tablecloths and some healthy optimism that the day would, in fact, warm up.<br>It was still early enough that the last of the breakfast crowd remained inside. Georgia pushed open the curtained door and stepped inside to the warmth of clean brick walls and the smell of fresh bread. She winked at the young man who stood chatting with a customer at the cash register as she strolled to the back of the restaurant.<br>"Ah, there she is," a male voice called out from behind immaculate stainless-steel counters. "Maria, didn't I tell you that Georgia would be here before nine this morning?"<br>"Why, yes, you did," the young waitress nodded. "Maybe you really are psychic, Lee."<br>"Well, there have been times we've suspected he might be, but not this time," Georgia laughed, "since I called him at eight to let him know I'd be stopping by -- "<br>"Fake." Maria flashed dark eyes good-naturedly at the tall man with the clipped, graying beard and the mildly amused expression.<br>"Spoilsport," he stage-whispered to Georgia, who laughed again. "So, what can I get you?"<br>"Water is fine," Georgia told him, "and I can get it."<br>"Help yourself." Lee Banyon gestured toward the refrigerator. "I have one last omelet to fix, then we can sit down and chat. Can I make something for you? I have some lovely ham," he added, a tease in his voice, knowing full well that Georgia was what she termed, semivegetarian -- eggs, dairy, on rare occasions perhaps fish, but never meat.<br>"I'll think about an omelet." She lifted a glass from the counter and filled it with chilled spring water. "And you know what you can do with your ham."<br>Lee laughed and juggled three dark green peppers before lining them up along the counter.<br>Leaning back against the cool steel, Georgia watched as Lee effortlessly chopped one of the peppers and several mushrooms and slid them into a pan, all the while moving with the grace of a dancer, which he had been until his self-imposed retirement eighteen months earlier. The death of Lee's longtimecompanion, David, had brought home the fragility of life, and Lee had quit his position as the principal male with the Inner Harbor Dance Troupe and had taken over running the restaurant David had opened six years earlier.<br>Tall, lanky, dark-haired, and handsome, Lee Banyon had been Georgia's best and closest friend from her earliest days with the troupe. Georgia's support and compassion during David's illness had won her a place in Lee's heart for all time. There was no question that Lee would walk through fire for her, would slay her dragons, if need be. Right now, Lee judged from the look in her eyes, a dragon lurked somewhere nearby, and as soon as he finished this last order, he would make it his business to find out where.<br>"Ready for a nibble, Georgey-girl?" he called to her. "You can't jog and dance and who knows what else without the proper fuel."<br>"Actually, I've been dreaming about one of your veggie concoctions for days. You know," she grinned, "the one with the broccoli, zucchini, onions, roasted red peppers..."<br>"You're on." He poked in the refrigerator for the last of the zucchini he had shredded earlier that morning and set about making breakfast for his friend.<br>"So, Miss Georgia," he said as he garnished the plate with thin slices of orange and wedges of cantaloupe, "what's on your mind this morning?"<br>"What makes you think that anything -- "<br>He held up one hand to stop her.<br>"Please, we've known each other far too well for much too long to start playing games now. I can see it in your face, <i>cara."</i> He guided her through the kitchen door into the now-emptied dining room and to a table near the window, pulled a chair out for her with one hand, and placed her plate before her with the other.<br><i>"Ummm."</i> She bit into a piece of broccoli and sighed. "Heaven. No one makes a veggie omelet like you do, Lee."<br>"Right. It's my secret combination of herbs and spices," Lee said dryly as he sniffed at a pot of coffee. Convinced of its freshness, he poured two cups and brought them to the table. "Don't try to change the subject. Tell Uncle Lee what's bothering you."<br>"Did you know that Mallory Edwards is in the hospital?" she asked.<br>"Yes, I had heard."<br>"I went to visit her a few days ago." She was avoiding eye contact and he knew it.<br>"I don't recall that you and Mallory were friends." A frown creased his brow. "Now that I think about it, I don't recall that Mallory had any friends at all within the troupe."<br>"We're really not, and I don't think she does."<br>"Then why the act of mercy?"<br>"I felt sorry for her, Lee. I was there when she collapsed. It was a terrible thing to see. One minute she was dancing, the next minute she sank to the floor like a marionette whose strings had all been cut at exactly the same time." Georgia shivered at the memory of it.<br>"Surely you've seen people faint before."<br>"I have, but this was different. This was..." -- she struggled for a word, then shook her head and repeated -- "different. Everyone saw her fall, and no one helped her. Ivan stood over her yelling at her to get up...."<br>"Ah, yes, Ivan would be the very soul of compassion," Lee, who had known the temperamental artistic director for years, murmured sarcastically.<br>"Finally one of the girls checked her pulse, and had a real hard time finding one. At first Ivan didn't want to call an ambulance, he kept insisting that she just wanted attention, that she would get up on her own. Of course, she did not, so we called nine-one-one."<br>"Over Ivan's objections, I would suspect."<br>Georgia scowled. "He didn't want paramedics coming into the studio, can you believe that? He actually wanted us to carry her into the lobby."<br>"I've always said that Ivan was a prince among men."<br>"Here's the scary part." Georgia sighed and put her fork down quietly. "Everyone knows that Mallory collapsed from malnutrition. We all know that she suffers from eating disorders. I'm not certain which one, but we all know there's something seriously wrong. She is a very ill young woman. In the hospital, she was hooked up to skatey-illion tubes and IVs, and yet she was talking about coming back in six weeks and taking over her old spot."<br>"And she probably will." Lee shrugged. "Surely you know that she's not the only member of your troupe who thinks she's found an easy means of weight control?"<br>"Easy?" Georgia's eyes widened, recalling Mallory's hollow cheekbones, pencil-thin fingers, large eyes set in a gaunt face. "If that's the easy way, I'd sure as hell hate to see the hard way."<br>"Well, I do not have to tell you, of all people, how unreasonable Ivan can be where his dancers' weights are concerned."<br>Georgia met his eyes across the table, but did not answer. She herself had been the victim of Ivan's tyrannical rages when she had weighed in a pound or two above the director's limits. For each of his dancers, Ivan kept a notebook in which he recorded their weights on a daily basis. Those whose weight fluctuated by a pound or two might be ridiculed in front of the other dancers, but those whose weight gain might exceed that would be subjected to humiliation of the cruelest form. Ivan could indeed be terrible.<br>"No," she told him. "I know that a lot of the dancers do dreadful things to themselves to keep their weight down. Not just in our company, but in just about every one that I know of."<br>"Eating disorders are as old as the dance, Georgia. Consider yourself fortunate that you never were afflicted."<br>"I do. But Lee, there's more." She averted her eyes again.<br>"Isn't there always?" Lee sighed and gestured for her to continue.<br>"Yesterday Ivan announced his choice to fill Mallory's spot. He made a big deal out of it in front of everyone."<br>"Let me guess." Lee narrowed his eyes and pretended to think. "His choice was...Georgia Enright."<br>"How did you know that?"<br>"Ivan is a petty, wicked little man and is as transparent as a beam of light. Somehow he must have found out that you had visited Mallory in the hospital. Ivan being Ivan, he will want to punish Mallory for disrupting his routine. How best to punish her? By replacing her with the only person who has shown her any kindness."<br>"I didn't realize that you knew him that well," she said softly.<br>"I have known Ivan for more years than I like to recall. We were in the same company in Boston, and then again in Houston. It was only coincidence that we both ended up in Baltimore together. Oh, yes, we go back a very long way. But that's old news." He leaned back in his seat and crossed his arms over his chest. "Did he give the other dancers the opportunity to challenge you for the role?"<br>"You do know him well, don't you?" She nodded glumly.<br>"He's done this before -- set several dancers against each other. Offer one a part, then ask if any of the others would like a chance to win the role away. Divide and conquer, so to speak. It's a means of maintaining control, you know. And it never fails to create a little drama, a little tension. Ivan, as we know, thrives on both."<br>"Well, so far, only one dancer has asked to audition. Sharyn Heffern. She was new last year. She's a wonderful dancer, Lee. She deserves the role much more than I do."<br>"What is the role, by the way?" he asked.<br><i>"Giselle."</i><br>Lee rolled his eyes to the heavens. "A very important ballet. A challenging one. And definitely not a role for novices. What in glory's name could the man be thinking? <i>Giselle</i> is demanding, it's difficult. It's dramatic ballet at its best, and it's -- " He paused. "Did you accept Ivan's offer?"<br>"I didn't accept or not accept. I was stunned. I couldn't respond. And he did his usual, you know, drop the bombshell, then turn heel and leave the room."<br>"Well, how do you feel about it?"<br>"I feel like...like I'm being used. It's just like you said. Like he's trying to hurt Mallory. And at the same time, he's humiliating me. He knows I don't deserve the position, he knows I'm not good enough. Sharyn can dance circles around me."<br>"I wouldn't be surprised if he had suggested to Sharyn that she audition -- it would be just his style. So, what are you going to do?"<br>"I don't know." Her voice dropped to a whisper and she looked into her friend's eyes, hoping for guidance. Georgia knew no one who could better understand her predicament. "On the one hand, it's the chance I always dreamed of. On the other, I know I will make a complete fool out of myself because I know that I don't deserve the role."<br>"And of course, to decline, you would have to publicly admit that you don't feel you're good enough, which will give Ivan sufficient cause never to offer you another shot at moving out of the corps."<br>"Which I probably would not ever get anyway." Georgia's shoulders sank a little farther. "If I accept, my limitations will be glaringly evident. It's a loselose situation for me. He's set me up, Lee. He knows that there's no way I could ever best Sharyn. She's young -- eighteen -- but she is exceptional. She's the one who deserves the big break."<br>She frowned, then added, "And there's one other thing that's bothering me on a somewhat different level."<br>He gestured for her to go on.<br>"If I accept this offer, I will knowingly be assisting him in hurting Mallory."<br>"Of course. That would be Ivan's intent." Lee rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Quite a dilemma for you, Georgey-girl."<br>"What would you do if you were in this situation, Lee?"<br>"Me?" He nodded thoughtfully, tapping his fingers lightly on the polished wood tabletop. "Well, actually, I was in a similar situation once."<br>"And?" She waited for him to continue.<br>"And I think that whatever I say will influence your choice, and I do not want that responsibility, Georgia. Whatever you decide to do, this is your call, <i>cara."</i> He paused and watched her face, suspecting that, for Georgia, this was both a moral as well as a career decision. "Maybe it would help if you took a look at your goals at this stage of your career."<br>With a slightly rounded fingernail, she traced the delicate embossed motif on the white paper napkin that lay on the table. "You know that all I ever wanted to do was to dance. From the time I was a little girl, I never dreamed of doing anything else."<br>Her eyes drifted toward the front window and the clouds that were gathering in a lazy gray sky.<br>"It never mattered to me that I had to work hard at it. I even loved that part. Working toward the goal was very important to me. I was very proud of myself when I met that goal, Lee. But I always knew that I would have to work harder than some of the other girls, and my dream of becoming a prima ballerina died when I was twenty-three. It took me a long time to accept that some dancers are just gifted -- that if you don't have that gift, you will be limited in how far you can rise as a dancer." She smiled a lopsided smile. "I have known for several years that I did not have the gift, Lee."<br>"You are a lovely dancer, Georgia," he told her honestly, wishing that he could, in all good conscience, assure her that she could one day be a star. But caring much too much for her to lie about something so important, he simply took her hands between his and gave them a squeeze.<br>"But I will never rise to that next level, and we both know it."<br>"So, then. This is leading somewhere...."<br>"I think I need to decide where I want to go from here. If I want to stay in dance, or move on."<br>"That's pretty drastic, Georgia."<br>"I'm twenty-six years old, Lee. I have no education to speak of. I started dancing professionally when I was sixteen. I had a tutor for my junior and senior years in high school and have a GED. I never gave a second's thought t...</p><h2>The Rubber Band (Nero Wolfe)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Nero Wolfe towers over his rivals. . . .

Orphaned during World War II, Judith wants to trace her origins. In this quest, she goes to a renowned psychiatrist and becomes the victim of his experiments in regression. When a woman in a dark green cape sets off bombs in London, Sir Stephen and Judith are faced with an intangible, mysterious force threatening their very existence. <br> Obsessive love is the subject of <i>Terror Stalks the Class Reunion;</i> psychic contact with a dead twin sister is the only defense against a murder in <i>Double Vision; Lucky Day,</i> compared to O.

With her daughter Carol Higgins Clark, she has coauthored five more suspense novels. More than one hundred million copies of her books are in print in the United States alone. Her books are international bestsellers.<b>From "The Anastasia Syndrome"</b> <p>With a combination of reluctance and relief, Judith closed the book she had been studying and laid her pen on top of her thick notebook. She had been working steadily for hours, and her back felt cramped as she pushed back the old-fashioned swivel chair and got up from the desk. The day was overcast. Long ago, she had turned on the powerful desk light she had bought to replace the elaborately fringed Victorian lamp which belonged in this furnished rental flat in the Knightsbridge district of London. </p> <p> Flexing her arms and shoulders, Judith walked over to the window and looked down at Montpelier Street. At 33, the grayness of the January day was already merging with the approaching dusk and the slight shudder of the windowpanes testified that the wind was still brisk. Unconsciously she smiled, remembering the letter she had received in answer to her inquiry about this place: </p> <p> "Dear Judith Chase, </p> <p> The flat will be available from 1 September until 1 May. Your references are most satisfactory, and it is a comfort to me to know that you will be engaged in writing your new book. The Civil War in seventeenth-century England has proved marvelously fertile to romantic writers and it is gratifying that a serious historical writer of your stature has chosen it. The flat is unpretentious but spacious and I think you will find it adequate. The lift is frequently out of order; however, three flights of stairs are not too formidable, do you think? I personally climb them by choice." </p> <p> The letter ended with a precise, spidery signature: "Beatrice Ardsley." Judith knew from mutual friends that Lady Ardsley was 83. </p> <p> Her fingertips touched the windowsill and she felt the cold, raw air forcing its way through the wooden frame. Shivering, Judith decided that she would have just enough time for a hot bath, if she hurried. Outside, the street was almost empty. The few pedestrians were scurrying along rapidly, their heads bent into their necks, coat collars rolled up. As she turned away, she saw a toddler running down the street just below her window. Horrified, Judith watched as the little girl tripped and fell into the road. If a car came around the corner, the driver wouldn't see her in time. There was an elderly man halfway down the street. She pulled at the window to scream for him to help, but then a young woman appeared from nowhere, darted into the road, scooped up the child and cradled it in her arms. </p> <p> "Mummy, Mummy," Judith heard it cry. </p> <p> She closed her eyes and buried her face in her hands as she heard herself wailing aloud, "Mummy, Mummy." Oh God. Not again! </p> <p> She forced herself to open her eyes. As she had expected, the woman and toddler had vanished. Only the old man was there, making his careful way along the sidewalk. </p> <p> The phone rang as she was fastening a diamond pin to the jacket of her silk faille cocktail suit. It was Stephen. </p> <p> "Darling, how did the writing go today?" he asked. </p> <p> "Very well, I think." Judith felt her pulse quicken. Forty-six years old and her heart leaped like a schoolgirl's at the sound of Stephen's voice. </p> <p> "Judith, there's a bloody emergency Cabinet meeting and it's running late. Do you mind terribly meeting me at Fiona's? I'll send the car." </p> <p> "Don't do that. A taxi will be quicker. If you're late, it's state business. If I'm late, it's bad business." </p> <p> Stephen laughed. "God, you do make my life easy!" His voice lowered. "I'm besotted with you, Judith. Let's only stay as long as we must at the party, then go off for a quiet dinner together." </p> <p> "Perfect. Good-bye, Stephen. I love you." </p> <p> Judith replaced the receiver, a smile playing on her lips. Two months ago, she had been seated at a dinner party next to Sir Stephen Hallett. "Quite the biggest catch in England," her hostess, Fiona Collins, confided. "Stunning looks. Charming. Brilliant. Home Secretary. It's common knowledge that he'll be the next Prime Minister. And darling Judith, best of all, he's eligible." </p> <p> "I met Stephen Hallett once or twice in Washington years ago," Judith said. "Kenneth and I liked him very much. But I came to England to write a book, not to get involved with a man, charming or not."</p> <p> "Oh nonsense," Fiona snapped. "You've been widowed for 10 years. That's quite long enough. You've made your name as an important writer. Darling, it really is nice to have a man around the house, especially if the house turns out to be 10 Downing Street. My bones tell me that you and Stephen would be perfect together. Judith, you're a beautiful woman, but you always send out signals saying 'Stay away, I'm not interested.' Don't do that tonight, please." </p> <p> She had not sent out those signals. And that night Stephen had escorted her home and come up for a nightcap. They had talked till nearly dawn. When he left, he had kissed her lightly on the lips. "If I have passed a more pleasant evening in my life, I don't remember it," he had whispered.</p> <p>Copyright � 1989 by Mary Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>The Lost Stars: Imperfect Sword</h2><p><b>The stellar spin-off to the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling The Lost Fleet series continues as the Syndicate&#x2019;s civil war threatens to spread even farther into the final frontier...</b><br><br>President Gwen Iceni and General Artur Drakon have successfully liberated the Midway Star System&#x2014;but the dictatorial former rulers of the Syndicate Worlds won&#x2019;t surrender the region without a fight.<br><br>Outnumbered and led by junior officers hastily promoted in the wake of the uprising, Midway&#x2019;s warships are no match for the fleet massing and preparing to strike.

At other stars, the crumbling but still-powerful and predacious empire of the Syndicate Worlds gathered forces and tried to stamp out revolution wherever it flared into existence. Midway, strategically positioned and a leader among the rebel star systems, knew it was only a matter of time until the Syndicate attacked again.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;I almost wish something would ha&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Don&#x2019;t</i> say it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Kommodor. It&#x2019;s just that there are few tasks more boring than standing sentry,&#x201d; Kapitan Diaz said. &#x201c;Especially deep in space far from any planet or orbiting facility.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And few things more dangerous than becoming bored or distracted as a sentry,&#x201d; Kommodor Marphissa reminded him, her voice sharp. &#x201c;Let alone jinxing us with careless wishes!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was about to say how important it was to stay alert,&#x201d; Diaz added quickly. He raised his voice for the benefit of the specialists on the bridge of the heavy cruiser <i>Manticore</i>. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re on sentry and not paying attention, some enemy might sneak up and stick a knife in you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or one of your superiors might catch you napping,&#x201d; Marphissa said. &#x201c;If that happens, you&#x2019;ll probably wish an enemy had killed you quickly instead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Syndicate way,&#x201d; Diaz agreed. &#x201c;But we rebelled against the Syndicate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re on sentry duty,&#x201d; Marphissa said. &#x201c;The Syndicate wants this star system back under their control.&#x201d; Her gaze shifted to the display before her command seat. The huge hypernet gate that helped make Midway Star System very important hung in space only ten light-minutes away, the massive structure seeming small and insignificant against a backdrop of endless stars. Space had a tendency to dwarf the mightiest human creations. The nearest ship traffic was almost a light-hour distant, a boxy freighter plodding steadily along toward the inner star system. President Iceni, the only one whose orders Marphissa would respect, was four light-hours away, on a planet orbiting only several light-minutes from the star. Marphissa&#x2019;s warships were on their own out here, as was she.</p><p>&#x201c;How long do you think it will be before they attack again?&#x201d; Diaz wondered.</p><p>Marphissa shifted irritably in her own seat. How many times had they had this conversation? &#x201c;Maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe in the next minute. The only thing we know for certain is that the Syndicate will be back, and they will be bringing a large enough flotilla to make us fight for our lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The battle cruiser should be operational again soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It needs to be operational <i>now</i>, along with our battleship,&#x201d; Marphissa grumbled, lowering her voice so only Diaz could hear. There were some things the specialists should not listen to. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be sitting ducks if the Syndicate returns with a battleship of their own, and all we still have in fighting condition are these cruisers and Hunter-Killers&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>An alert blared, causing everyone on the bridge to jerk to full alertness and frantically focus on their displays as a new symbol sprang to life near the hypernet gate. Ten minutes ago, something had arrived at the gate, the light from that event one hundred eighty million kilometers away only now reaching Marphissa&#x2019;s own flotilla. Boredom and irritation vanished in a flare of excitement and fear as Marphissa waited for <i>Manticore</i>&#x2019;s combat systems to identify the new arrival.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting a Syndicate ID on it,&#x201d; the senior watch specialist reported, drawing a curse from Kapitan Diaz.</p><p>Marphissa had once envied those who commanded flotillas, imagining them free of the day-to-day responsibilities that kept lesser souls in constant labor and worry. But she had already learned that the burdens of being in charge, of having no one else to turn to for orders and guidance, were as heavy as a neutron star and as unforgiving as the pull of gravity from a black hole.</p><p>And Marphissa would have to make all of the decisions. It would be almost four more hours before President Iceni even saw that a new Syndicate ship had arrived in this star system.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>THERE were times when President Gwen Iceni regretted having learned that not every problem could be solved by ordering someone to be killed.</p><p>This was one of those times.</p><p>Because at this moment she really, really wanted to kill someone.</p><p>&#x201c;We know that the next Syndicate attack could come at any time,&#x201d; she told General Artur Drakon in what Iceni thought a remarkably well-controlled voice. The way his defensive glower deepened at her words led her to suspect that her voice might not be as controlled as she thought. &#x201c;There are unknown forces moving against us within this star system, though we&#x2019;ve managed to keep the citizens quiet for now by giving them some voice in their own affairs. Supreme CEO Haris at Ulindi might try attacking us again. And, of course, we never know when the enigmas might return and wipe us all out. Did I forget any problems we currently face?&#x201d;</p><p>He met her eyes, defiant despite the obvious guilt he felt. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t entirely trust each other.&#x201d; Drakon paused, then added more in even darker tones. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t entirely trust our own closest subordinates.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you agree we had more than enough things to worry about before this.&#x201d; Gwen sat back, sighing heavily. &#x201c;Why do I trust you at all, Artur Drakon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you have to. The same reason that&#x2019;s always been there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I could have tried to have you killed. Where is she now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Colonel Morgan? In her quarters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Her quarters.&#x201d; Iceni let the two words hang for a long moment. &#x201c;After she exploited her position as one of your closest aides to betray you, that&#x2019;s all you&#x2019;re going to do?&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon ran one hand through his hair, looking away. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t decided. I told you. There are complications&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Whatever Drakon had been about to say was interrupted by a high-priority alarm. Iceni tapped acknowledge, hoping her jerk of surprise hadn&#x2019;t been apparent to Drakon. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; she snapped as the image of her personal aide/bodyguard/assassin Mehmet Togo appeared beside her desk.</p><p>&#x201c;A ship has arrived at the hypernet gate&#x2014;&#x201d; Togo began, his voice and expression both as placid as if nothing could ever unnerve or even annoy him.</p><p>&#x201c;One ship? Why is that so critical?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Syndicate ship.&#x201d;</p><p>Iceni felt a chill at odds with the earlier heat of her anger at Drakon and Morgan. &#x201c;Just one? Did the Syndicate send an unescorted battleship to attack us this time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The ship is a courier vessel,&#x201d; Togo continued. &#x201c;It informs us that it carries one passenger, CEO Jason Boyens. The courier ship is en route this planet. Even though it is identifying itself as under official Syndicate control, it claims to be operating independently.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Boyens? Alone?&#x201d; She looked at Drakon, who frowned again.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell does he want?&#x201d; Drakon growled. Boyens was known to both of them from his long service with the old Reserve Flotilla, but after going to the Syndicate supposedly to negotiate an end of hostilities, he had instead returned to Midway in command of a Syndicate flotilla attacking this star system. Timely assistance to Midway from Black Jack&#x2019;s Alliance fleet had forced Boyens to flee that time, but now he was back without any warships.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever it is, he&#x2019;s putting himself into our hands.&#x201d; She sat back, pushing aside her anger at Morgan and at Drakon, letting Boyens&#x2019;s sudden reappearance filter through the Machiavellian paths that experience in the Syndicate system had worn in her mind.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want to kill him?&#x201d; Drakon asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon grinned ferociously. &#x201c;Not right away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Agreed. Let&#x2019;s see what he can tell us, first,&#x201d; Iceni said. She didn&#x2019;t want to pursue further the topic of Morgan&#x2019;s treachery at this moment, so did not object when Drakon made a quick departure to make his own preparations for dealing with whatever news Boyens was bringing.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>FIVE minutes after Drakon returned to his headquarters, Iceni forwarded a message from Boyens that she had just received.</p><p>Colonel Bran Malin began backing out of Drakon&#x2019;s private office. &#x201c;I will leave you to discuss the matter with President Iceni, General.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hold it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;General,&#x201d; Malin said, &#x201c;I fully understand that your confidence in me has been damaged and that I cannot expect to be given the same access to critical issues until your concerns regarding me have been resolved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right that I&#x2019;m going to be watching you more in days to come,&#x201d; Drakon said. &#x201c;But recent revelations about you and Morgan do not alter the fact that I have come to value your insight and opinions. Let&#x2019;s both see what Boyens has to say.&#x201d;</p><p>Even Malin could not help a very brief smile at Drakon&#x2019;s words, but all he said was, &#x201c;Yes, sir. You won&#x2019;t regret it, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>The image of CEO Jason Boyens appeared, looking confident but also regretful. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t insult you,&#x201d; Boyens began, &#x201c;by pretending I don&#x2019;t realize that I am now the one who needs to make a deal for my own survival. I want you to realize how much I can do for you. The last time I was in this star system, I may have looked like I was in charge of that Syndicate flotilla, but I wasn&#x2019;t. There was a snake CEO at my back, literally at my back, almost every moment. The slightest misstep would have resulted in my death, and you at the mercy of a snake CEO instead of a friend like me.&#x201d;</p><p><i>A friend?</i> Drakon thought. <i>Does he expect me to believe that he&#x2019;s now a friend?</i></p><p>&#x201c;I have information that you need,&#x201d; Boyens continued. &#x201c;I could have gone to a lot of different places when I escaped from Prime. I came here. Give me a chance to show you how I can help you. Boyens, out.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon glanced at Malin. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;</p><p>Malin considered the question, his head tilted slightly to one side. &#x201c;His story is plausible, General. Having a senior Internal Security Service agent monitoring his every move would have been a reasonable precaution for the current Syndicate government.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they couldn&#x2019;t trust Boyens, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. But he may know some very important things if he has been at all aware of what the Syndicate is planning.&#x201d; Malin nodded toward where Boyens&#x2019;s image had been. &#x201c;He appears to have intended that message solely for President Iceni.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I noticed.&#x201d; Iceni was clearly telling him that they remained allies despite recent discoveries about problems among Drakon&#x2019;s closest aides. &#x201c;All right. We&#x2019;ve seen that message and talked about it. Now, let&#x2019;s talk about you.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon drummed the fingers of his left hand on his desk as he eyed Malin. He had been granted very little time to absorb the news of Malin&#x2019;s true relationship to Morgan, the huge secret Malin had kept from him and everyone else. <i>On the other hand, if my mother was Roh Morgan, I doubt that I would want anyone knowing, either.</i> &#x201c;Never mind CEO Boyens. Can I still trust <i>you</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>Malin usually struck people as reserved to the point of coldness, but now he seemed frozen inside at the question. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. General, I will not betray you. I never have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are there any more secrets that I should know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>The multitude of hidden sensors focused on Malin provided their verdict on the surface of Drakon&#x2019;s desk, the words polarized so as to be invisible to Malin himself. <i>No deception noted.</i> But Malin was as well trained as anyone could be in fooling the sensors that measured signs of dishonesty. &#x201c;I want the simple truth out of you, Colonel. Where does your loyalty lie?&#x201d;</p><p>The question puzzled Malin. &#x201c;With you, General. I am loyal to you above all others.&#x201d;</p><p><i>No deception noted.</i> &#x201c;Have you been working with Colonel Morgan in any way I am not aware of? Engaged in any projects I did not order you to pursue?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;</p><p><i>No deception noted.</i> &#x201c;Any other person in my position would have you shot. You know that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Drakon demanded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been one of my closest assistants, you know just about everything about my forces and contingency plans, and you kept that kind of secret from me. You know too much for someone who misled me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same could be said of Colonel Morgan, sir,&#x201d; Malin said, his words coming out as carefully as if they were footsteps through a minefield.</p><p>&#x201c;I agree. Why shouldn&#x2019;t I have <i>both</i> of you shot?&#x201d;</p><p>Malin gazed at him, his face rigid. &#x201c;You have always been able to count on me, sir. Give me any task, and it will be done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That much is true,&#x201d; Drakon admitted. &#x201c;And I will admit that is also one of the reasons I&#x2019;m wondering if I can afford to trust you any longer. You&#x2019;re too damned good at getting things done. I need to be sure you&#x2019;re only acting for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am, General. At this moment, you have a very important task facing you. If you are going to let Morgan live, then you need me to protect you from her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re no match for Morgan. You couldn&#x2019;t stop her if she tried to kill me.&#x201d;</p><p>Malin made a self-deprecating gesture. &#x201c;Not if it was a direct attack, no. But she won&#x2019;t do that, General. She is intensely loyal to you even though that loyalty is warped. Morgan won&#x2019;t try to physically harm you, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean she won&#x2019;t do other things. I can monitor her, watch for schemes, plots, and unauthorized activities. I can identify anyone who contacts her, no matter the means.&#x201d;</p><p>Drakon considered the alternatives, then nodded. Until he knew more about what Morgan was up to, there was no one better suited for discovering her secrets than Malin. &#x201c;Do not make me sorry for giving you another chance,&#x201d; Drakon said, his own words as cold as Malin&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;There will not be any more chances after this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand, sir. Thank you for the opportunity to prove my continued loyalty to you.&#x201d; Malin saluted, then left.</p><p>Drakon sat watching the sealed door after Malin had departed, wondering if he had just made a deal with one devil in order to frustrate the plans of another. But Malin had been invaluable in the past and, aside from the secret regarding his real mother, had never shown any signs of disloyalty or unreliability. In all ways, Malin had always appea...</p></p><h2>Life in Medieval Times (Perigee)</h2><p>An age of chivalry, color, and faith from which the modern world still draws inspiration&#x2014;or centuries of violence, squalor, and superstition best forgotten?

Originally published in 1979, <i>Wildflowers of Iowa Woodlands</i> introduced many naturalists to the beauty and diversity of the native plants of the wooded communities that once covered more than 6 million acres of the state. Now redesigned with updated names and all-new images, this reliable field companion will introduce woodland wildflowers to a new generation of outdoor enthusiasts in the Upper Midwest.<br><br>The species accounts are accompanied by brilliant full-page color photographs by Larry Stone, Thomas Rosburg, and Carl Kurtz. In clear, straightforward, and accessible prose, authors Sylvan Runkel and Alvin Bull provide common, scientific, and family names; the Latin or Greek meaning of the scientific names; habitat and blooming times; and a complete description of plant, flower, and fruit. Particularly interesting is the information on the many ways in which Native Americans and early pioneers used these plants for everything from pain relief to insecticides to tonics. <br><br>Iowa&#x2019;s original savannas, woodlands, and forests were cleared with amazing thoroughness, yet enough beauty and diversity remain to give joy to hikers, birders, and mushroomers. <i>Wildflowers of Iowa Woodlands</i> will inspire both amateurs and professionals with the desire to learn more about the wonders of today&#x2019;s woodlands.</p><p>Sylvan Runkel (1906&#x2013;1995) was the coauthor of five books about midwestern wildflowers, including <i>Wildflowers of the Tallgrass Prairie</i> and <i>Wildflowers and Other Plants of Iowa Wetlands</i>. A vigorous promoter of conservation for many years, he was honored in 1996 by the dedication of the Sylvan Runkel State Preserve. Alvin Bull (1925&#x2013;1982) was the coauthor of three books about midwestern wildflowers, including <i>Wildflowers of Indiana Woodlands</i> and <i>Wildflowers of Illinois Woodlands</i>. He was vice-president of Farm Progress Companies and editorial director for the <i>Indiana Prairie Farmer</i>, <i>Prairie Farmer</i>,<i> Wallaces Farmer,</i> and the <i>Wisconsin Agriculturist</i>.&#x201c;In the tradition that only Sy Runkel can claim, <i>Wildflowers of Iowa Woodlands</i> has long provided plant enthusiasts with identification tips, habitat affinities, Native American and pioneer uses, and general ethnobotanical folklore of frequently observed wildflowers in the Midwest. The species represent a broad range of wooded environments, including dry rocky or sandy woodlands, oak savannas, mesic forests, and swamps and floodplain forests. This revised edition, presented in a beautifully designed vertical format, has all-new color photographs and updated scientific names. It is a treasure chest of tidbits, a valuable companion for wandering naturalists and those family hikes in the woods. This is a book you&#x2019;ll find yourself using again and again.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas Rosburg, Drake University</p><h2>White Rose, Black Forest</h2><p><p><b>An Amazon Charts bestseller.</b></p><p><b>In the shadows of World War II, trust becomes the greatest risk of all for two strangers.</b></p><p>December 1943.

But when it turns out that he is not who he seems, Franka begins a race against time to unravel the mystery of the airman&#x2019;s true identity.

What do we mean when we use the term? And can it ever truly exist?</b> <b>Astra Taylor, hailed as a &#x201c;New Civil Rights Leader&#x201d; by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, provides surprising answers.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>There is no shortage of democracy, at least in name, and yet it is in crisis everywhere we look. From a cabal of plutocrats in the White House to gerrymandering and dark-money compaign contributions, it is clear that the principle of government by and for the people is not living up to its promise. </p><p>The problems lie deeper than any one election cycle. As Astra Taylor demonstrates, real democracy&#x2015;fully inclusive and completely egalitarian&#x2015;has in fact never existed. In a tone that is both philosophical and anecdotal, weaving together history, theory, the stories of individuals, and interviews with such leading thinkers as Cornel West and Wendy Brown, Taylor invites us to reexamine the term. Is democracy a means or an end, a process or a set of desired outcomes? What if those outcomes, whatever they may be&#x2015;peace, prosperity, equality, liberty, an engaged citizenry&#x2015;can be achieved by non-democratic means? In what areas of life should democratic principles apply? If democracy means rule by the people, what does it mean to rule and who counts as the people? </p><p>Democracy's inherent paradoxes often go unnamed and unrecognized. Exploring such questions, <i>Democracy May Not Exist</i> offers a better understanding of what is possible, what we want, why democracy is so hard to realize, and why it is worth striving for.</p></p><p><b>Astra Taylor</b> is the author of <i>The People's Platform</i><i> (</i>winner of the American Book Award) and made two documentary films, <i>Zizek!</i> and <i>Examined Life. </i>Taylor&#x2019;s writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>n+1</i>, and <i>The Baffler</i>, where she is a contributing editor. She lives in New York City.<p>"Astra Taylor will change how you think about democracy... She unpacks it, wrestles with it, with the question of who gets included and how...she excavates the invisible assumptions that have been bred into our idea of democracy... Taylor's work is alive to paradoxes, ambiguities, and hard questions that don't offer easy answers." <b>&#x2015;Ezra Klein</b>, The Ezra Klein Show</p><p>"We live in an age that demands that we rethink democracy from the roots&#x2015;and teach ourselves to think again as citizens. Smart and engaging, Astra Taylor&#x2019;s Democracy May Not <i>Exist </i>makes a formidable contribution to meeting those pressing generational challenges." <b>&#x2015;Danielle Allen</b>, author of <i>Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality </i></p><p>"A brilliant, deeply learned discourse on democracy, equality, and how the second might save the first, by one of the most incisive thinkers on participatory politics today." <b>&#x2015;Molly Crabapple</b>, author of <i>Brothers of the Gun </i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"What a lot of trouble democracy has been! Over the years it&#x2019;s been hijacked by its enemies, its reforms have backfired, it has evaded challenges, it has refused to heed its prophets. But as Astra Taylor reminds us in this timely and sagacious book, there is no substitute. The fate of the world depends on it." <b>&#x2015;Thomas Frank</b>, author of <i>Listen, Liberal</i></p><p>"What is this thing called Democracy? Google the question and you will exceed one million hits. But for an honest and illuminating answer, read this book&#x2015;every single word. Searching, lucid, visionary, Astra Taylor takes a deep oceanic dive into the history, meaning, uses, and promise of democracy&#x2015;moving from Plato&#x2019;s Greece to Syriza&#x2019;s Greece, from the Global South to post-Communist East, from slavery to fascism, liberalism to neoliberalism, Occupy to the Commons. She knows what most political scientists don&#x2019;t: that democracy is a promise unfulfilled, and in our strivings to achieve it nothing is guaranteed. But we can&#x2019;t live without it."<br><b>&#x2015;Robin D. G. Kelley</b>, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination </i></p><p>"Astra Taylor is a rare public intellectual, utterly committed to asking humanity&#x2019;s most profound questions yet entirely devoid of pretensions and compulsively readable. Now she plunges deep into the crisis that underlies so many others: the sorry state (and the exhilarating promise) of this thing called democracy. At once richly historical and immediately relevant, this wise, lucid and unflinchingly honest book deserves to be at the center of public debate." <b>&#x2015;Naomi Klein</b>, author of<i> No Is Not Enough</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;Moths never reach the moon, but they navigate by it; we humans may never reach democracy, Astra Taylor tells us, but we navigate by its ideals.

Over thirty million perished in a grain shortage brought on not by flood, drought, or infestation, but by the insanely irresponsible dictates of Chairman Mao Ze-dong's "Great Leap Forward," an attempt at utopian engineering gone horribly wrong. </p><p>Journalist Jasper Becker conducted hundreds of interviews and spent years immersed in painstaking detective work to produce Hungry Ghosts, the first full account of this dark chapter in Chinese history. In this horrific story of state-sponsored terror, cannibalism, torture, and murder, China's communist leadership boasted of record harvests and actually increased grain exports, while refusing imports and international assistance. With China's reclamation of Hong Kong now a fait accompli, removing the historical blinders is more timely than ever. As reviewer Richard Bernstein wrote in the New York Times, "Mr. Becker's remarkable book...strikes a heavy blow against willed ignorance of what took place."</p></p><p>This first authoritative expose of the 1958-1962 famine prompted by China&#39;s collectivization plan, &#34;The Great Leap Forward,&#34; comes at a time when the cult of Mao is alive and well inside China, and while agents of Chinese influence are able to arrange audiences with a President. Via his painstaking research and reporting that included two treks through interior Chinese provinces, Becker tells how the famine occurred because ill-trained peasants were forced to undertake a gigantic and centralized industrial and agricultural expansion. The new factories, canals, and irrigation systems failed spectacularly, and in contrast to propaganda boasts of having economically outstripped the U.S., when in reality the populace was driven by starvation to cannibalism, slavery, and madness.<p><b>Jasper Becker</b> is currently Beijing bureau chief for the<i> South China Morning Post.</i> He has also written extensively on Chinese affairs for <i>The Guardian, The Economist, </i>and <i>The Spectato</i>r.

Self-published by Nicolar in 1893, this is one of the few sustained narratives in English composed by a member of an Eastern Algonquian-speaking people during the nineteenth century. At a time when Native Americans&#x2019; ability to exist as Natives was imperiled, Nicolar wrote his book in an urgent effort to pass on Penobscot cultural heritage to subsequent generations of the tribe and to reclaim Native Americans&#x2019; right to self-representation. This extraordinary work weaves together stories of Penobscot history, precontact material culture, feats of shamanism, and ancient prophecies about the coming of the white man. An elder of the Penobscot Nation in Maine and the grandson of the Penobscots&#x2019; most famous shaman-leader, Old John Neptune, Nicolar brought to his task a wealth of traditional knowledge.<p></p><p><i>The Life and Traditions of the Red Man</i> has not been widely available until now, largely because Nicolar passed away just a few months after the printing of the book was completed, and shortly afterwards most of the few hundred copies that had been printed were lost in a fire. This new edition has been prepared with the assistance of Nicolar&#x2019;s descendants and members of the Penobscot Nation. It includes a summary history of the tribe; an introduction that illuminates the book&#x2019;s narrative strategies, the aims of its author, and its key themes; and annotations providing historical context and explaining unfamiliar words and phrases. The book also contains a preface by Nicolar&#x2019;s grandson, Charles Norman Shay, and an afterword by Bonnie D. Newsom, former Director of the Penobscot Nation&#x2019;s Department of Cultural and Historic Preservation. <i>The Life and Traditions of the Red Man</i> is a remarkable narrative of Native American culture, spirituality, and literary daring.</p></p><p>"Joseph Nicolar's The Life and Traditions of the Red Man is surely a landmark text, and Annette Kolodny's framing helps make the narrative come alive."--Philip Deloria, author of Indians in Unexpected Places <p>"The Life and Traditions of the Red Man is an extraordinary rendering of Eastern Algonquian history, story, and prophecy, self-published in the nineteenth century by a native writer from the northeast coast of the United States.

But today their relationship is strained. China&#x2019;s military buildup deeply worries Japan, while Japan&#x2019;s brutal occupation of China in World War II remains an open wound. In recent years less than ten percent of each population had positive feelings toward the other, and both countries insist that the other side must deal openly with its history before relations can improve.</p><p>From the sixth century, when the Japanese adopted core elements of Chinese civilization, to the late twentieth century, when China looked to Japan for a path to capitalism, Ezra Vogel&#x2019;s <i>China and Japan</i> examines key turning points in Sino-Japanese history. Throughout much of their past, the two countries maintained deep cultural ties, but China, with its great civilization and resources, had the upper hand. Japan&#x2019;s success in modernizing in the nineteenth century and its victory in the 1895 Sino-Japanese War changed the dynamic, putting Japan in the dominant position. The bitter legacy of World War II has made cooperation difficult, despite efforts to promote trade and, more recently, tourism.</p><p>Vogel underscores the need for Japan to offer a thorough apology for the war, but he also urges China to recognize Japan as a potential vital partner in the region. He argues that for the sake of a stable world order, these two Asian giants must reset their relationship, starting with their common interests in environmental protection, disaster relief, global economic development, and scientific research.</p></p><p>Ezra F.

Matthiessen, a student of Zen Buddhism, was also on a spiritual quest to find the Lama of Shey at the ancient shrine on Crystal Mountain. The result is a remarkable account of a journey both physical and spiritual, as the arduous climb yields to Matthiessen a deepening Buddhist understanding of reality, suffering, impermanence, and beauty.</p><p><b>Peter Matthiessen </b>(1927&#x2013;2014)<b> </b>is the only writer to win the National Book Award for fiction and nonfiction. A cofounder of <i>The Paris Review</i>, he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a recipient of its William Dean Howells Award, among many other honors. He was also a world-renowned naturalist, explorer, activist, and Buddhist teacher.<b>Prologue</b><p>In late September of 1973, I set out with GS on a journey to the Crystal Mountain, walking west under Annapurna and north along the Kali Gandaki River, then west and north again, around the Dhaulagiri peaks and across the Kanjiroba, two hundred and fifty miles or more to the Land of Dolpo, on the Tibetan Plateau.</p><p>GS is the zoologist George Schaller. I knew him first in 1969, in the Serengeti Plain of East Africa, where he was working on his celebrated study of the lion.1* When I saw him next, in New York City in the spring of 1972, he had started a survey of wild sheep and goats and their near relatives the goat-antelopes. He wondered if I might like to join him the following year on an expedition to northwest Nepal, near the frontier of Tibet, to study the bharal, or Himalayan blue sheep; it was his feeling, which he meant to confirm, that this strange &#x201c;sheep&#x201d; of remote ranges was actually less sheep than goat, and perhaps quite close to the archetypal ancestor of both. We would go in the autumn to observe the animals in rut, since the eating and sleeping that occupied them throughout the remainder of the year gave almost no clue to evolution and comparative behavior. Near Shey Gompa, &#x201c;Crystal Monastery,&#x201d; where the Buddhist lama had forbidden people to molest them, the bharal were said to be numerous and easily observed. And where bharal were numerous, there was bound to appear that rarest and most beautiful of the great cats, the snow leopard. GS knew of only two Westerners&#x2014;he was one&#x2014;who had laid eyes on the Himalayan snow leopard in the past twenty-five years; the hope of glimpsing this near-mythic beast in the snow mountains was reason enough for the entire journey.</p><p>Twelve years before, on a visit to Nepal, I had seen those astonishing snow peaks to the north; to close that distance, to go step by step across the greatest range on earth to somewhere called the Crystal Mountain, was a true pilgrimage, a journey of the heart. Since the usurpation of Tibet by the Chinese, the Land of Dolpo, all but unknown to Westerners even today, was said to be the last enclave of pure Tibetan culture left on earth, and Tibetan culture was the last citadel of &#x201c;all that present-day humanity is longing for, either because it has been lost or not yet been realized or because it is in danger of disappearing from human sight: the stability of a tradition, which has its roots not only in a historical or cultural past, but within the innermost being of man. . . .&#x201d;2 The Lama of Shey, the most revered of all the rinpoches, the &#x201c;precious ones,&#x201d; in Dolpo, had remained in seclusion when a scholar of Tibetan religions3 reached the Crystal Monastery seventeen years ago, but surely our own luck would be better.</p><p>On the way to Nepal, I stopped at Varanasi, the holy city on the Ganges, and visited the Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya and Sarnath. In those monsoon days of mid-September, the brown heat of India was awesome, and after a few days on the Ganges Plain, I was glad to fly north to Kathmandu, in the green foothills of the Himalayan wall. That day was clear, and among the temple spires and tiered pagodas, black kites and red veered on the wind. The dry air at 4000 feet was a great relief from the humidity of India, but in the north the peaks were hidden by thick clouds of the monsoon, and by evening it was raining.</p><p>I found GS at the hotel. We had not met in a year or more, our last correspondence had been in midsummer, and he was relieved that I had turned up without mishap. For the next two hours we talked so intensely that I wondered later if there was anything left to speak about in the months ahead; we shall have no company but each other, and we do not know each other very well. (Of GS, I had written earlier that &#x201c;he is single-minded, not easy to know,&#x201d; and &#x201c;a stern pragmatist, unable to muster up much grace in the face of unscientific attitudes; he takes a hard-eyed look at almost everything.&#x201d; He was also described as a &#x201c;lean, intent young man,&#x201d;4 and I find him as lean and as intent as ever.)</p><p>The rains prevailed throughout the last three days in Kathmandu. GS was desperate to get under way, not only because he loathes all cities but because winter comes early to the Himalaya, and these rains of the monsoon would bring heavy snow to the high passes between this place and our destination. (We later learned that the October rains set an all-time record.) Months before, he had applied for permission to enter Dolpo, but only now, on the final day, were permits granted. Last letters were written and sent off; there would be no mail where we were going. All excess gear and clothing were discarded, and traveler&#x2019;s checks exchanged for small rupee notes by the dirty packet, since large bills have no currency among the hill peoples. With our Sherpa camp assistants, we packed tents and pots, and bargained for last-minute supplies in the Oriental rumpus of the Asan Bazaar, where in 1961 I had bought a small bronze Buddha, green with age. My wife and I were to become students of Zen Buddhism, and the green bronze Buddha from Kathmandu was the one I chose for a small altar in Deborah&#x2019;s room in the New York hospital where she died last year of cancer, in the winter.</p><p>In the early morning of September 26, in a hard rain, with a driver, two Sherpas, and all expedition gear, we packed ourselves into the Land Rover that would carry us as far as Pokhara; two more Sherpas and five Tamang porters were to come next day by bus, in time for departure from Pokhara on the twenty-eighth. But all arrivals and departures were in doubt; it had rained without relent for thirty hours. In the calamitous weather, the journey was losing all reality, and the warm smile of a pretty tourist at the hotel desk unsettled me; where did I imagine I was going, where and why?</p><p>From Kathmandu there is a road through Gorkha country to Pokhara, in the central foothills; farther west, no roads exist at all. The road winds through steep gorges of the Trisuli River, now in torrent; dirty whitecaps filled the rapids, and the brown flood was thickened every little while by thunderous rockslides down the walls of the ravine. Repeatedly the rocks fell on the road: the driver would wait for the slide to ease, then snake his way through the debris, while all heads peered at the boulders poised overhead. In raining mountains, a group of shrouded figures passed, bearing a corpse, and the sight aroused a dim, restless foreboding.</p><p>After midday, the rain eased, and the Land Rover rode into Pokhara on a shaft of storm light. Next day there was humid sun and shifting southern skies, but to the north a deep tumult of swirling grays was all that could be seen of the Himalaya. At dusk, white egrets flapped across the sunken clouds, now black with rain; on earth, the dark had come. Then, four miles above these mud streets of the lowlands, at a point so high as to seem overhead, a luminous whiteness shone&#x2014;the light of snows. Glaciers loomed and vanished in the grays, and the sky parted, and the snow cone of Machhapuchare glistened like a spire of a higher kingdom.</p><p>In the night, the stars convened, and the vast ghost of Machhapuchare radiated light, although there was no moon. In the shed where we lay down, behind a sort of inn, there were mosquitoes. My friend, dreaming, cried out in his sleep. Restless, I went out at daybreak and saw three peaks of Annapurna, soaring clear of low, soft clouds. This day we would depart for the northwest.</p><p><b>Westward</b></p><p>Just as a white summer cloud, in harmony with heaven and earth freely floats in the blue sky from horizon to horizon following the breath of the atmosphere&#x2014;in the same way the pilgrim abandons himself to the breath of the greater life that . . . leads him beyond the farthest horizons to an aim which is already present within him, though yet hidden from his sight.</p><p>LAMA GOVINDA<br>The Way of the White Clouds</p><p>All other creatures look down toward the earth, but man was given a face so that he might turn his eyes toward the stars and his gaze upon the sky.</p><p>OVID<br>Metamorphoses</p><b>SEPTEMBER 28</b><p>At sunrise the small expedition meets beneath a giant fig beyond Pokhara&#x2014;two white sahibs, four Sherpas, fourteen porters. The Sherpas are of the famous mountain tribe of northeast Nepal, near Namche Bazaar, whose men accompany the ascents of the great peaks; they are Buddhist herders who have come down in recent centuries out of eastern Tibet&#x2014;sherpa is a Tibetan word for &#x201c;easterner&#x201d;&#x2014;and their language, culture, and appearance all reflect Tibetan origin. One of the porters is also a Sherpa, and two are refugee Tibetans; the rest are of mixed Aryan and Mongol stock. Mostly barefoot, in ragged shorts or the big-seated, jodhpur-legged pants of India, wearing all manner of old vests and shawls and headgear, the porters pick over the tall wicker baskets. In addition to their own food and blankets, they must carry a load of up to eighty pounds that is braced on their bent backs by a tump line around the forehead, and there is much hefting and denunciation of the loads, together with shrill bargaining, before any journey in these mountains can begin. Porters are mostly local men of uncertain occupation and unsteadfast habit, notorious for giving trouble. But it is also true that their toil is hard and wretchedly rewarded&#x2014;about one dollar a day. As a rule, they accompany an expedition for no more than a week away from home, after which they are replaced by others, and the hefting and denunciation start anew. Today nearly two hours pass, and clouds have gathered, before all fourteen are mollified, and the tattered line sets off toward the west.</p><p>We are glad to go. These edges of Pokhara might be tropical outskirts anywhere&#x2014;vacant children, listless adults, bent dogs and thin chickens in a litter of sagging shacks and rubble, mud, weeds, stagnant ditches, bad sweet smells, vivid bright broken plastic bits, and dirty fruit peelings awaiting the carrion pig; for want of better fare, both pigs and dogs consume the human excrement that lies everywhere along the paths. In fair weather, all this flux is tolerable, but now at the dreg end of the rainy season, the mire of life seems leached into the sallow skins of these thin beings, who squat and soap themselves and wring their clothes each morning in the rain puddles.</p><p>Brown eyes observe us as we pass. Confronted with the pain of Asia, one cannot look and cannot turn away. In India, human misery seems so pervasive that one takes in only stray details: a warped leg or a dead eye, a sick pariah dog eating withered grass, an ancient woman lifting her sari to move her shrunken bowels by the road. Yet in Varanasi there is hope of life that has been abandoned in such cities as Calcutta, which seems resigned to the dead and dying in its gutters. Shiva dances in the spicy foods, in the exhilarated bells of the swarming bicycles, the angry bus horns, the chatter of the temple monkeys, the vermilion tikka dot on the women&#x2019;s foreheads, even in the scent of charred human flesh that pervades the ghats. The people smile&#x2014;that is the greatest miracle of all. In the heat and stench and shriek of Varanasi, where in fiery sunrise swallows fly like departing spirits over the vast silent river, one delights in the smile of a blind girl being led, of a Hindu gentleman in white turban gazing benignly at the bus driver who reviles him, of a flute-playing beggar boy, of a slow old woman pouring holy water from Ganga, the River, onto a stone elephant daubed red.</p><p>Near the burning ghats, and the industry of death, a river palace has been painted with huge candy-striped tigers.</p><p>No doubt Varanasi is the destination of this ancient Hindu at the outskirts of Pokhara, propped up on a basket borne on poles across the shoulders of four servants&#x2014;off, it appears, on his last pilgrimage to the Mother Ganges, to the dark temples that surround the ghats, to those hostels where the pilgrim waits his turn to join the company of white-shrouded cadavers by the river edge, waits again to be laid upon the stacks of fired wood: the attendants will push this yellow foot, that shriveled elbow, back into the fire, and rake his remains off the burning platform into the swift river. And still enough scraps will remain to sustain life in the long-headed cadaverous dogs that haunt the ashes, while sacred kine&#x2014;huge white silent things&#x2014;devour the straw thongs that had bound this worn-out body to its stretcher.</p><p>The old man has been ravened from within. That blind and greedy stare of his, that caved-in look, and the mouth working, reveal who now inhabits him, who now stares out.</p><p>I nod to Death in passing, aware of the sound of my own feet upon my path. The ancient is lost in a shadow world, and gives no sign.</p><p>Gray river road, gray sky. From rock to torrent rock flits a pied wagtail.</p><p>Wayfarers: a delicate woman bears a hamper of small silver fishes, and another bends low beneath a basket of rocks that puts my own light pack to shame; her rocks will be hammered to gravel by other women of Pokhara, in the labor of the myriad brown hands that will surface a new road south to India.</p><p>Through a shaft of sun moves a band of Magar women, scarlet-shawled; they wear heavy brass ornaments in the left nostril. In the new sun, a red-combed rooster clambers quickly to the roof matting of a roadside hut, and fitfully a little girl starts singing. The light irradiates white peaks of Annapurna marching down the sky, in the great rampart that spreads east and west for eighteen hundred miles, the Himalaya&#x2014;the alaya (abode, or home) of hima (snow).</p><p>Hibiscus, frangipani, bougainvillea: seen under snow peaks, these tropical blossoms become the flowers of heroic landscapes. Macaques scamper in green meadow, and a turquoise roller spins in a golden light. Drongos, rollers, barbets, and the white Egyptian vulture are the common birds, and all have close relatives in East Africa, where GS and I first met; he wonders how this vulture would react if confronted with the egg of an ostrich, which was also a common Asian bird during the Pleistocene. In Africa, the Egyptian vulture is recognized as a tool-using species, due to its knack of cracking the huge ostrich eggs by slinging rocks at them with its beak.</p><p>Until quite recently, these Nepal lowlands were broadleaf evergreen sal forest (Shorea robusta), the haunt of elephant and tiger and the great Indian rhinoceros. Forest-cutting and poaching cleared them out; except in last retreats such as the Rapti Valley, to the southeast, the saintly tread of elephants is gone. The last wild Indian cheetah was sighted in central India in 1952, the Asian lion is reduced to a single small population in the Gir Forest, northwest of Bombay, and the tiger becomes legendary almost everywhere. Especially in India and Pakistan, the hoofed animals are rapidly disappearing, due to destruction of habitat by subsistence agriculture, overcutting of the forests, overgrazing by the scraggy hordes of domestic animals, erosion, flood&#x2014;the whole dismal cycle of events that accompanies overcrowding by human beings. In Asia more than all places on earth, it is crucial to establish wildlife sanctuaries at once, before the last animals are overwhelmed. As GS has written, &#x201c;Man is modifying the world so fast and so drastically that most animal...</p></p><h2>How I Found God in Everyone and Everywhere: An Anthology of Spiritual Memoirs</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Much can be gained from trailing the spiritual&nbsp;narratives of those who have&nbsp;traveled ahead of us, for&nbsp;the God they&nbsp;have found, we may&nbsp;never have&nbsp;considered. <i>How I&nbsp;Found God in Everyone and Everywhere</i> captures for a general audience the spiritual shift away from popular notions of&nbsp;a God "up there" and "out there" and toward immanent and inclusive understandings of a&nbsp;God in our very midst. It's built around the fascinating personal journeys of a close-knit&nbsp;group of prominent contributors, leaders including Deepak Chopra, Richard Rohr, Rupert Sheldrake, Matthew Fox, Cynthia Bourgeault, Ilia Delio, Keith Ward and others.<br><br>As these diverse spiritual memoirs testify, for many today, the spiritual journey has lead to the discovery of a divine reality that, it turns out, we already inhabit, one that encompasses us all. Sometimes called "panentheism," this relational and participatory vision is allowing for a "return to God after God" and thus a continuation of the spiritual journey. This God is not found in some people and some places, but in everyone and everywhere.</p><p><br><b>Andrew M. Davis</b> is a philosopher, theologian, and scholar of world religions.

But as the post-World War II boom began to sputter, economists gained influence and power.<br><br>In <i>The Economists' Hour</i>, Binyamin Appelbaum traces the rise of the economists, first in the United States and then around the globe, as their ideas reshaped the modern world, curbing government, unleashing corporations and hastening globalization.<br><br>Some leading figures are relatively well-known, such as Milton Friedman, the elfin libertarian who had a greater influence on American life than any other economist of his generation, and Arthur Laffer, who sketched a curve on a cocktail napkin that helped to make tax cuts a staple of conservative economic policy.<br><br>Others stayed out of the limelight, but left a lasting impact on modern life: Walter Oi, a blind economist who dictated to his wife and assistants some of the calculations that persuaded President Nixon to end military conscription; Alfred Kahn, who deregulated air travel and rejoiced in the crowded cabins on commercial flights as the proof of his success; and Thomas Schelling, who put a dollar value on human life.<br><br>Their fundamental belief? That government should stop trying to manage the economy.<br><br>Their guiding principle? That markets would deliver steady growth, and ensure that all Americans shared in the benefits. <br><br>But the Economists' Hour failed to deliver on its promise of broad prosperity. And the single-minded embrace of markets has come at the expense of economic equality, the health of liberal democracy, and future generations.<br><br>Timely, engaging and expertly researched, <i>The Economists' Hour</i> is a reckoning-and a call for people to rewrite the rules of the market.</p><p>Binyamin Appelbaum writes about economics and business for the editorial page of <i>The New York Times</i>. From 2010 to 2019, he was a Washington correspondent for the <i>Times</i>, covering economic policy in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. He previously worked for <i>The Charlotte Observer</i>, where his reporting on subprime lending won a George Polk Award and was a finalist for the 2008 Pulitzer Prize.<b>Longlisted for the Porchlight Business Book Award in Narrative &amp; Biography </b><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Editor's Choice</b><b> A <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Business Bestseller </b><b>One of <i>Oprah Magazine</i>'s Best Political Books to Read Ahead of the 2020 Election </b><b>One of Book Riot's 50 Best Books to Read this Fall </b><b>One of Five Books' Best Political Books of 2019</b> <br><br>"His book is a marvel of popular historical writing, propelled by anecdotes and just the right amount of explanation but also impressively well grounded in the latest academic research by historians, sociologists and others.

Appelbaum argues that their heyday ended on October 13 2008, when the chief executives of America's largest banks were marched into the US Treasury for a crisis meeting. He is surely correct. The mother of all Wall Street bailouts shattered the reputation economics had gained over the previous 40 years. Yet economists' hubris lingers. Perhaps it is a lagging indicator.

It is traditionally characterised as the study of &#34;being qua being&#34; - of being in general rather than specifically of this or that sort. Accordingly, the salient task of the field is to achieve a clearer understanding of the concepts and principles of being, existence, and reality. As such, metaphysics has been an established sector of philosophy since the time of Aristotle&#39;s initial systematisation of the subject in the fourth century B.C.E.In line with tradition, distinguished philosopher Nicholas Rescher presents key topics that have always figured on the agenda of metaphysics: the nature and rationale of existence, the differentiation of what is actual from the unreal and mere possibility, and the prospects and limits of our knowledge of the real. Though a work of philosophical sophistication and logical rigour, &#34;Metaphysics&#34; displays a clarity of exposition that makes it suitable for use as a text or supplementary reader in upper-class undergraduate and graduate philosophy courses.</p><p><b>ARISTOTLE</b>&nbsp;was born in the northern Greek town of Stagira in 384 B.C.E., where his father was the personal physician to the great-grandfather of Alexander the Great. At the age of eighteen Aristotle entered Plato's Academy and soon became recognized as its most important student. He<b>&nbsp;</b>remained under Plato's tutelage for nearly twenty years.<br><br>After his teacher's death in 347 B.C.E., Aristotle cultivated associations with other Academy students throughout Greece and Asia Minor. Then in 342 B.C.E., Aristotle was asked by King Philip II of Macedonia to become the tutor for his young son Alexander, who was later to become the conqueror of much of the known world at that time. The young prince remained under Aristotle's supervision until 336 B.C.E., when he acceded to the throne after his father's death. Two years later Aristotle returned to Athens and founded his own school, which he called the Lyceum. This intellectual center flourished during the years when Alexander the Great ruled Greece as part of his large empire. But upon Alexander's death in 323 B.C.E., Aristotle was charged with impiety by Athenians who resented his associations with the Macedonian conqueror. Rather than risk the same fate as Plato's mentor, Socrates, Aristotle fled to the city of Chalcis, where he died in 322 B.C.E.<br><br>Aristotle's interests, like those of Plato, were diverse and his writing cast its shadow on many fields, including logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and the sciences. Among his most well-known works are:&nbsp;<i>The Categories, The Prior and Posterior Analytics, The Physics, The Meta�physics, De Anima, The Nicomachean Ethics,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Politics.</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>It&#39;s Been a Good Life</h2><p>New one-volume autobiography spans Asimov&#39;s life for the first time!As one of the most gifted and prolific writers of the twentieth century, Isaac Asimov became legendary for his inexhaustible creativity, wide-ranging intellectual curiosity, and talent for explaining complex subjects in clear, concise prose. While regaling his readers with an incredible opus of almost five hundred entertaining and illuminating science fiction and nonfiction books, he also found time to write a three-volume autobiography. Now these volumes have been condensed into one by Asimov&#39;s wife, Janet, who also shares excerpts from letters he wrote to her. Together these writings provide an intimate portrait of a creative genius whose love of learning and playing with ideas is evident on every page. Reading this autobiography is like sitting down with Isaac Asimov and experiencing his witty, engaging, and brilliant personality firsthand. We are treated to many marvelous stories about his upbringing in Depression-era Brooklyn, his early fascination with the new science fiction pulp magazines, the thrill of his first published story, the creation of his well-known story &#34;Nightfall,&#34; the genesis of the Foundation series, and the evolution of his creative life as a writer. He also reveals his inner thoughts about and experiences with various luminaries in science and science fiction. Above all, Asimov&#39;s autobiography conveys unbounded enthusiasm for his craft, the infectious joy of learning and creating, complete intellectual honesty, his strong humanist convictions, and his infinite fund of good humor and optimism even at the end of his life - all told in the lively clear writing style that was his trademark. Although Janet Jeppson Asimov concludes this work with a shocking revelation about her husband&#39;s death, the volume is clearly intended as a celebration - as the title suggests - of a wonderful, creative life. As a poignant coda to this work, Janet has appended one short story that was Isaac&#39;s favorite, and his 400th essay on this thoughts about science.</p><p>"Without question, Isaac was one of the Great Men of Our Time. Wildly witty, inexhaustively creative, core-of-the-Earth deep and wide in wisdom and knowledge, he was also Great Company. Yes, his was a 'good life,' for him; but more important, he made it a better-than-good life for all of us--just by having existed." -- Harlan Ellison <p>"Isaac Asimov was certainly the Shakespeare of the twentieth century--no other author, no ten other authors, matched his output in range, quantity, clarity, joy, and depth of writing about the growth of knowledge and human conditions. Grab this autobiography for a fascinating, delightful series of glimpses into the many lives of this extraordinary writer." -- Paul Levinson, author of THE SILK CODE </p><p>"Who better than Janet Asimov to delineate the innermost thoughts of the seer, author, and nontheist we know as the science-fiction genius who coined 'robotics' and intrigued us with the memorable Foundation and robot novels! IT'S BEEN A GOOD LIFE is a hoot and a must read!" -- Warren Allen Smith, author of WHO'S WHO IN HELL</p>As one of the most gifted and prolific writers of the twentieth century, Isaac Asimov has become a literary legend. In reflecting on his years and his career in the last volume of his autobiographical trilogy, he said modestly, "It's been a good life." <p>Now ten years after her husband's death, Janet Jeppson Asimov has carefully mined the depths of Asimov's most personal thoughts about his life and work. She lovingly combines these with revealing excerpts from his letters to create an intimate portrait of a genius whose tireless passion for writing is evident on every page. </p><p>Throughout the book, Asimov shares many important experiences: his years as a child prodigy in Depression-era Brooklyn, his early fascination with science-fiction pulp magazines, the thrill of his first published story, the creation of his well-known story "Nightfall," the genesis of the Foundation and robot series, and how he evolved as a creative writer. Significant moments throughout his life are described with Asimov's characteristic wit, sense of humor, and ever-present optimism. </p><p>IT'S BEEN A GOOD LIFE envelops the reader with the warmth and wisdom of Asimov's unique style as though engaged in an exclusive conversation with the author. Beyond offering a compelling chronology of the events in the author's life, many chapters highlight subjects and ideas that were particularly important to him: religion and the Bible, Shakespeare, and humanism, to name a few. Featured in this volume are "The Last Question," which Asimov admitted to being his favorite story, his 400th essay on his thoughts about science, and several never-before-published photos. In the revised epilogue, written by Janet, she reveals the true story of Isaac's final illness and death. </p><p>Isaac Asimov revolutionized what it means to be a writer. He created superbly enlightening science and history books about the world around him and wonderful science-fiction worlds where his readers could lose themselves for hours. No other twentieth-century writer wrote with such Shakespearean eloquence or had more of a literary impact than Isaac Asimov. Simply put, IT'S BEEN A GOOD LIFE is a behind-the-scenes look at genius and a must-have for Asimov fans as well as science and science-fiction fans in general.</p></p><h2>Henry Suso: The Exemplar, with Two German Sermons (Classics of Western Spirituality (Paperback))</h2><p>The most in-depth and scholarly panorama of Western spirituality ever attempted!<p>In one series, the original writings of the universally acknowledged teachers of the Catholic, Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Islamic and Native American traditions have been critically selected, translated and introduced by internationally recognized scholars and spiritual leaders.</p><p>The texts are first-rate, and the introductions are informative and reliable.

His achievements in the show ring and as a sire were enough to put him in the record books. The 1981 bay stallion was the American Quarter Horse Association's first repeat winner of the Superhorse title (awarded to the champion all-around horse at the AQHA World Show) and is the only Superhorse to have sired not one but two Superhorse offspring along with a reserve.<br>But it was Rugged Lark's other career, that of touring equine goodwill ambassador, that turned him into a crowd-drawing superstar. His 10 years' worth of bridleless freestyle performances, set to music and guided by rider/trainer Lynn Palm, delighted thousands and brought tears to the eyes of even the most hardened horsemen. In venues ranging from the 1996 Olympic Games to sessions of the Special Olympics, he drew people into his aura and made them appreciate and want to own an American Quarter Horse.<br>Along with earning titles, siring champions and winning fans, Rugged Lark had the ability to dispel myths. He was, for instance, his dam's first foal, defying the widespread belief that &#x201c;first foals don't amount to much.&#x201d; Sired by a Thoroughbred racehorse, out of a predominately western performance mare, and sometimes called a &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; because of it, he won English and western events alike even as skeptics may have doubted his ability to do either. He was a stallion who spent enough time in the breeding shed to have sired more than 370 foals, yet could be trusted with children and indeed seemed to seek them out whenever a crowd of admirers hemmed him in.<br>Palm's memories of the horse include these.<br>&#x201c;Lark just loved people, and he loved to perform. After every performance, he'd have a crowd around him, and he always put his nose down to touch little kids. He'd be standing at the doorfront of a stall, surrounded by so many people that we couldn't even get to him, and it'd be the little kids who had his attention. He was such a personable horse, always looking up into the crowd when he performed and happy to be petted and loved on by strangers when he was done. I was so blessed to be part of his life &#x2015; he was a great, great horse.&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>Last of the Giants: The True Story of Guns N&#39; Roses</h2><p><p><b>INCLUDES BRAND NEW CHAPTER COVERING GUNS N' ROSES EPIC WORLD TOUR</b></p><p>Many millions of words have already been written about Guns N' Roses, the old line-up, the new line-up. But none of them have ever really gotten to the truth. Which is this: Guns N' Roses has always been a band out of time, the Last of the Giants. They are what every rock band since the Rolling Stones has tried and nearly always failed to be: dangerous. At a time when smiling, MTV-friendly, safe-sex, just-say-no Bon Jovi was the biggest band in the world, here was a band that seemed to have leapt straight out of the coke-smothered pages of the original, golden-age, late-sixties rock scene.</p><p>'Live like a suicide', the band used to say when they all lived together in the Hell House, their notorious LA home.

This cleverly presented new volume may change that. The Economics Book takes a unique approach to elucidating this often murky subject through well-written entries. Arranged by both subtopic and time frame, the history of economic theory, notable world events, and biographies of key players are presented in six chapters, titled &#x201c;Let the Trading Begin (400 BCE&#x2013;1770 CE),&#x201d; &#x201c;The Age of Reason (1770&#x2013;1820),&#x201d; &#x201c;Industrial and Economic Revolutions (1820&#x2013;1929),&#x201d; &#x201c;War and Depressions (1929&#x2013;1945),&#x201d; &#x201c;Post-War Economics (1945&#x2013;1970),&#x201d; and &#x201c;Contemporary Economics (1970&#x2013;present).&#x201d; Chapters vary in length from 10 to 27 entries, each accompanied by an &#x201c;In Context&#x201d; sidebar and voluminous supporting illustrations, including flowcharts, graphs, and pictures. The book concludes with a directory of influential economic thinkers, a brief glossary, and an adequate index. The book&#x2019;s brilliance lies in its packaging of economic theory into easily digestible essays (e.g. &#x201c;The Economy is a Yo-Yo: Boom and Bust&#x201d;; &#x201c;Make the Polluter Pay: External Costs&#x201d;; &#x201c;Crowds Breed Collective Insanity: Economic Bubbles&#x201d;). Overall, this book will make economics not only accessible but potentially even fascinating to a wide range of readers at and above a high-school reading level. --Jennifer Michaelson</p><h2>Edge of Empire: Lives, Culture, and Conquest in the East, 1750-1850</h2><p>In this imaginative book, Maya Jasanoff uncovers the extraordinary stories of collectors who lived on the frontiers of the British Empire in India and Egypt, tracing their exploits to tell an intimate history of imperialism. Jasanoff delves beneath the grand narratives of power, exploitation, and resistance to look at the British Empire through the eyes of the people caught up in it. Written and researched on four continents, <i>Edge of Empire</i> enters a world where people lived, loved, mingled, and identified with one another in ways richer and more complex than previous accounts have led us to believe were possible. And as this book demonstrates, traces of that world remain tangible&#x2014;and topical&#x2014;today. An innovative, persuasive, and provocative work of history.</p><p><b>Maya Jasanoff</b>&nbsp;is the Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard. She is the author of the prize-winning&nbsp;<i>Edge of Empire: Lives, Culture, and Conquest in the East</i>,<i>&nbsp;1750-1850</i>&nbsp;(2005) and&nbsp;<i>Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World</i>&nbsp;(2011), which received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Non-Fiction and the George Washington Book Prize. A 2013 Guggenheim Fellow, Jasanoff won the 2017 Windham-Campbell Prize for Non-Fiction. Her essays and reviews appear frequently in publications including&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i>.Most histories would begin the account of Britain, France, and their empires not in the East, but in the West: in North America, where Britain&#x2019;s thirteen colonies and New France commanded the Atlantic seaboard, and where the two powers had been vying for dominance since the early 1600s. Their competition reached its climax in the middle of the eighteenth century, during the Seven Years War. The focus of their antagonism was access to the alluring expanse of land beyond the Pennsylvania frontier. With that struggle, Britain and France were effectively fighting for the future of North America: who would win the right to shape it, and whose empire would thrive. Perhaps this story should begin in the West, too, on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, in the summer of 1759, where the best-known eighteenth-century scene of Anglo-French imperial war unfolded&#x2014;the battle of Quebec, whose set-piece quality brought recurrent patterns of British and French conflict vividly to life.<br><br> Since the declaration of war in 1756, British attempts to advance into New France had been frustrated. But in the early summer of 1759, a British offensive advanced into Canada along the lower St. Lawrence, arriving at the key French city of Quebec. All summer long the British lay camped by the river, besieging the heavily fortified town perched on the cliffs above. But the French, secure in their position and numbers, remained implacable, while British attempts to attack the city from below were repulsed. In September, British commanders fixed on a plan to strike Quebec from above and so lure the enemy out to battle on the Plains of Abraham, to the north. It was a bold maneuver. The cliffs were steep, the city was strong, the British severely outnumbered. But now, three months into the siege, it was time for such a move. On the night of September 12, 1759, a silent flotilla of British boats crossed the perilous St. Lawrence River and landed nearly five thousand men, who scrabbled up the beetling cliffs in a thin red line.<br><br> With the sun rising in a low mist, the black, pungent smell of waterlogged soil, damp, but no more rain: it was as good a day as any for battle. Behind Quebec&#x2019;s thick stone walls, the sleepless French commander, the Marquis de Montcalm, had heard cannon fire in the night and knew that some sort of trouble was at hand. In the morning, he gathered his men and trooped out of the city to see what had happened. Perhaps the British had managed to squeeze a few hundred men up the cliff? Instead he confronted a stunning sight. There, not one mile ahead of him, stood the entire British force, thousands of redcoats like beacons in the mist. There was no choice but to attack. At ten o&#x2019;clock, the French charged, only to be cut down, just forty paces from the British line, by a barrage of musket fire. Through the clearing smoke and chaos of bodies, the British began their counterattack; the French, confused and terrified, scattered in the face of attack. &#x201c;They run; see how they run!&#x201d; cried a British soldier. &#x201c;Never was a rout more complete than that of our army,&#x201d; reported a Frenchman. At nine o&#x2019;clock that very night, the French began to retreat from Quebec, leaving the city&#x2014;and the keys to French Canada&#x2014;in the hands of their British foes.<br><br> What had been months, even years, in the making, was over in a matter of hours. So were the lives of the French and British commanders. The Marquis de Montcalm took a ball in the torso late in the action, and was carried back to the town, bleeding profusely and saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, it&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d; Through the long night of retreat, he lay dying; his burial the next day, in the words of the historian Francis Parkman, &#x201c;was the funeral of New France.&#x201d; Out on the Plains of Abraham, the young British general James Wolfe aimed to achieve a more glorious death. While he was leading the charge against the French lines, his wrist was shattered by a bullet; still he rushed, till two more hit him in the belly and the chest, and he fell to the ground. Some officers said that on the river crossing the previous night, Wolfe had been reciting Thomas Gray&#x2019;s &#x201c;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.&#x201d; If so, one line would have particularly resonated: &#x201c;The paths of glory lead but to the grave.&#x201d; As if on cue, Wolfe expired near the battlefield, while his men charged to victory around him.<br><br> General Wolfe&#x2019;s victory at Quebec is one of the grand scenes of British imperial history, a rare individual battle that really did (seem to) turn the tables. And like so many acclaimed victories, its drama rested in part on a string of depressing defeats that had preceded it. Now, three years into the fighting, Britons finally had something to celebrate: voices were raised in hymns and prayers of thanksgiving, church bells rang, fireworks exploded. Wolfe&#x2019;s fatal heroism was applauded and retold in popular ballads, stage plays, published firsthand accounts, paintings and prints. By far the most famous representation appeared a full decade later, however. The Death of General Wolfe, painted by an up-and-coming Pennsylvania-born artist called Benjamin West, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the spring of 1771. Promptly reproduced in a bestselling etching, relentlessly emulated&#x2014;and satirized&#x2014;the painting became an instant icon of British art. Part of its appeal lay in an arresting immediacy: rarely if ever had a grand-manner history painting depicted its protagonists in modern dress rather than classical togas. But more lay in its subject matter. This was the ultimate clash of civilizations. The Seven Years War is known in America as the French and Indian War, and those were the villains: effete French aristocrats, Jesuits, natives of blood-curdling savagery. Arrayed against them, in West&#x2019;s picture, stood the best of the British Empire: bluff John Bulls in their red coats, tartan-wrapped Scots, sturdy colonials from New England farms, and a pensive, statuesque Indian fresh from the Ontario woods. (The Indian, among other things, was a pure invention of West&#x2019;s; none fought with Wolfe.) This was the British Empire of the 1760s as it liked to be seen. No accident that it was painted by a colonial&#x2014;and at a tense moment in Anglo-American relations, at that.<br><br> Thanks partly to its flattering misrepresentations, West&#x2019;s painting conveyed two key points about the Seven Years War: this was a war between Britain and France for imperial power, and a war that Britain triumphantly won. Yet the painting&#x2019;s enduring popularity takes attention away from what, in retrospect, may well have been the defining imperial battle of this defining imperial war. For while Wolfe at Quebec seized the imagination of his peers (and many since), it was a near-contemporaneous victory on the other side of the world that would ultimately have more effect on the shape of the British Empire. It had been won two years earlier, at Plassey, on the steamy banks of the River Hooghly, in Bengal. There, in 1757, East India Company troops under the command of Robert Clive defeated the nawab of Bengal and asserted military dominance in a territory larger than Britain itself.<br><br> Distant though it was from the European and North American flashpoints of the Seven Years War, and an Anglo-French battle only by proxy (the nawab was said to be cultivating French allies), the victory at Plassey set in train a series of events that affected Britain&#x2019;s global position as profoundly as the defeat of the French in Quebec. With the nawabs beaten and an East India Company puppet installed instead, the Mughal power structure in Bengal was decisively dislodged. The Company sealed its victory in 1765, when the emperor granted it the right to collect Bengal&#x2019;s valuable tax revenue, the diwani. From this point onward, the East India Company took on the functions of a state in addition to those of a merchant body. Soon it was India, not the thirteen colonies, that would claim the heart of the British Empire.<br><br> If one had to announce a time and place for the birth of the modern British Empire, then it would be in the far-flung contests of the Seven Years War. Many of the consequences of that conflict, such as a strengthening of British imperial patriotism, had long antecedents. And many of the changes wrought by the war were in some ways merely a prologue to the epochal upheavals of the Revolutionary-Napoleonic Wars to come. Nevertheless, the Seven Years War marked a watershed in the history of the British and French empires.<br><br> In territorial scope alone, the war surpassed previous conflicts. Since 1689, Britain and France had fought three long wars already, on the European continent and increasingly overseas. But this was the fiercest, most expensive, and most expansive war that Britain and France had waged to date. They clashed everywhere, from Montreal to Martinique, from the mouth of the Gambia in West Africa to the sudden rock outcroppings of South India. And almost everywhere, Britain won. The scale of British victory surprised even the victors. The prime minister William Pitt the Elder, who trumpeted patriotism as his watchword, dubbed 1759 his annus mirabilis: in that year alone, Wolfe secured British dominance in Canada; the French navy was demolished and Britain won access to the Mediterranean; and at Minden, in Hanover, British forces helped score that most precious of feats, a decisive land victory over France. Less than a year later, Sir Eyre Coote continued to rout France in India with his victory at Wandewash, in the south. The Americas, the Continent, and India: it seemed as if the whole world was falling into British hands, and at France&#x2019;s expense.<br><br> But victory had its price. After peace was signed in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Britain faced an empire that was larger, costlier, and more far flung than ever before. Manpower had to be found to defend it, manpower for which Britain regularly turned to its margins and colonies&#x2014;Scotland, Ireland, America, and increasingly India. Money had to be found to pay for it, money that Britain also looked to its colonies to provide. The notorious Stamp Act, passed in 1765, imposed a tax on printed material in the thirteen colonies. In 1767 followed the Townshend Duties on various British imports in America, including tea, which had fast become a staple of imperial trade and of the Anglo-American palate. Britain could justify these duties in part as a way of asking the colonists to contribute to the costs of their own defense. To some colonists, however, the taxes seemed to be little better than the despotic measures of the Oriental tyrants in the empires of the East. If the Seven Years War won Britain a greater empire than ever, it also touched off the financial and political crises that would cause the thirteen colonies to break away not twenty years later.<br><br> The Seven Years War had a profound effect on Britain&#x2019;s imperial geography, winning Britain important footholds around the world but also fatally weakening its ability to rule the thirteen colonies. These changes in where Britain had its empire were accompanied by changes in the kind of empire it now possessed. Historians used to treat the American Revolution as a dividing line between two distinct eras of British imperial history: a &#x201c;first&#x201d; British empire that was Atlantic, colonial, and mercantile; and a &#x201c;second&#x201d; empire, based in Asia and characterized by conquest and direct rule. The opposition of these two misleads. For what the Seven Years War heralded was the emergence of a British Empire that could be both Atlantic and Asian, commercial and conquering. It marked the beginning of a modern British Empire that was global and land-based, one that needed enormous resources&#x2014;human, economic, and cultural&#x2014;to keep it going.<br><br> The Seven Years War also had tremendous significance for the French empire&#x2014;but not, as conventional wisdom would have it, simply by ringing its death knell. (Almost no historians write about the overseas French empire between 1763 and the invasion of Algeria in 1830.) Indeed, though France lost the war, it pursued its ongoing struggle with Britain with renewed vigor. The ink was hardly dry on the peace treaty before Louis XV&#x2019;s shrewd chief minister, the Duc de Choiseul, began to prepare for the guerre de revanche. France reformed and modernized its army, and substantially increased the size of its navy&#x2014;a navy that performed against Britain to devastating effect at Yorktown in 1781, precipitating Britain&#x2019;s surrender in the American Revolution. It built up its continental alliances, and its Caribbean commerce flourished. Finally, France turned its imperial eyes keenly toward the East. Choiseul and his successors actively researched the possibility of invading Egypt&#x2014;the stepping-stone to India&#x2014;and sent Admiral Bougainville scouting for new colonies in the Pacific, thus provoking Britain. Because French history is so often divided up by political r�gimes (the Ancien R�gime, Napoleon&#x2019;s First Empire, the Restoration, and so on), continuities across periods often get neglected. But if one looks at French imperial policy, a more unified picture emerges. Notably, some of Choiseul&#x2019;s undertakings would find echo under Napoleon a generation later. French imperialism did not die after the Seven Years War; it just changed its tune.<br><br> Rather than put an end to Anglo-French imperial rivalry, then, or tip the scales definitively in Britain&#x2019;s favor, the Seven Years War opened a new chapter in the history of both the British and French empires. It signified a turn toward territorial gain and, with it, direct rule over manifestly foreign subjects. It also, critically, marked a swing to the East as a site of imperial desire. From this point on, the history of British and French imperial rivalry would unfold there, and in India in particular. Over the course of the next century, British power dramatically expanded in India and steadily reached beyond it, to Egypt, China, Afghanistan. France dedicatedly worked to thwart British expansion in India and to build its own influence in the Middle East and North Africa, where by 1900 it would be the dominant European power. In short, the Seven Years War fueled an Anglo-French competition for Eastern empire that would burn on and explode, in India and Egypt, more than thirty years later. So what did the British Empire look like viewed from the mango groves of Plassey, instead of from the Plains of Abraham? In many ways, rather different. Unlike Quebec, Plassey was not fought for the open conquest of territory, nor was it fought explicitly against the French. It was chiefly fought not by Crown troops but instead by the private army of the East India Company and its native Indian troops, or sepoys, in defense of commercial interests. And to stand in contrast to the youthfully gallant (if also neurotically self-absorbed) Wolfe of Quebec, Plassey cast into the public eye an altogether more complicated and more equivocal hero: Robert Clive, who, while hailed by some in Britain as the &#x201c;heaven-born general,&#x201d; would also find himself, and the empire he represented, the target of public attack. The history of British imperial collecting in the East began with the battle of Plassey and with Robert Clive. For it was there that Britain began to collect its empire in India and began the process of its own imperial refashioning, from a mercantile, Atlantic-based, colonial power to a global territorial ruler and an imperial nation-state. It was also at Plassey that Robert Clive became British India&#x2019;s first major imperial collector, acquiring a vast personal fortune that he would use to transform himself into the greatest&#x2014;and most reviled&#x2014;potentate of Britain&#x2019;s emerging empire in the East.</p><h2>Swans: Sacrifice And Transcendence: The Oral History</h2><p><i>"I&#x2019;m no stranger to failure, and I&#x2019;m aware it can arrive at any minute&#x2014;as it often has.

Sandy Woodward with Patrick Robinson</h2><p>Updated for the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War, this is the bestselling, highly-acclaimed and most famous account of the conflict, written by the commander of the British Task Force. On 5 April 1982, three days after the invasion of the Falkland Islands, British armed forces were ordered to sail 8,000 miles to the South Atlantic unaware of what lay ahead of them or whether they would be committed to war with Argentina. In these engrossing memoirs, Admiral Sandy Woodward, Task Force commander from the aircraft carrier Hermes, takes us from day one to day one hundred of the conflict; from sailing through the waters of the Atlantic with hopes of a political settlement fading, and war becoming increasingly likely, to the repulse of the Argentinian navy and the daring amphibious landing at San Carlos Water. The war, which cost the lives of over 1,000 men, has left a legacy of many historical debates and controversies, from the sinking of ships such as HMS Coventry, HMS Sheffield and Sir Galahad, and the Argentinian cruiser, the Belgrano, to wider issues such as what was it like to command and fight a modern air and naval war, the biggest naval action since World War II. `One Hundred Days&#39; is unique as a dramatic portrayal of the world of modern naval warfare, where despite the use of sophisticated equipment and communications, the margins for human error and courage were as wide as they were in the days of Nelson.</p><p>Admiral Sir John Woodward entered the Royal Navy at age 13 in 1946; he became a submarine specialist.

The merchant, his blue skin darkened with age, stood stoop-shouldered in the doorway leading into his shop. Shar had seen him tending to the plants outside his storefront on more than one occasion during his walks through this part of the city. In his hands, the shopkeeper wielded a rusted metal bucket, which he now shook before him in Shar&#x2019;s direction.<br><br>&#x201c;Get away from here, you traitor!&#x201d; the old man repeated, stepping down from the doorway onto the sidewalk lining the row of buildings on this side of the narrow street. He raised one arm and pointed a long, wrinkled finger at Shar. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want you here!&#x201d;<br><br>Shar held up his hands to indicate he presented no threat, still trying to fathom what he might have done&#x2014;or failed to do&#x2014;to call forth the aged merchant&#x2019;s ire. He had been warned about isolated instances where other Starfleet personnel&#x2014;none of them Andorians&#x2014;had encountered such behavior, but none had been reported here in Lor&#x2019;Vela. Indeed, he had come to think of this part of the city as his new home, just as many Andorians had in the year since the Borg invasion. The largest population center on Andor to weather the attack relatively intact, the city had served in the months that followed as a rally point for survivors across the neighboring regions, with sprawling refugee camps springing up along the coastline and in the foothills to the north and west. While much of the city lay within and beneath the surrounding mountain range, this section had been constructed aboveground, reminding Shar of his childhood home. The reconstituted, provisional Andorian planetary government now was located here, having summoned lower-ranking officials from cities and provinces around the world to fill the void left by the loss of so many political leaders. Laibok, the former capital city, had fallen to Borg weaponry in the opening moments of the attack, with much of the surrounding region being laid to waste. Had Shar been on Andor when the invasion began, he would have been working there, and certainly would have numbered in the millions of casualties recorded on that day.<br><br><i>And now someone here might want to help correct that oversight. You should go. Now.</i><br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not looking for any trouble,&#x201d; he said, keeping his voice low and doing his best to impart no trace of anger or resentment over what the shopkeeper had done to him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The older Andorian cut him off, shaking a fist at him. &#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re doing! I&#x2019;ve seen you on the newsnets. You and those other traitors, working with the Federation to wipe away our culture. Our very identity!&#x201d;<br><br>Shar rebuked himself for his stupidity. Had he missed a briefing about upswings in anti-Starfleet sentiment within Lor&#x2019;Vela? So far as he knew, the city had experienced little of the civil unrest that had plagued other areas in recent months, but to expect that not to change at some point was the height of na�vet�. This was particularly true in light of the steps Starfleet and the Federation&#x2014;working in concert with the Andorian government and Homeworld Security&#x2014;had taken to retain order among the populace as the planet struggled to rebuild from the devastation inflicted by the Borg. Though Lor&#x2019;Vela had seemed at the outset like a haven of cooperative spirit between Andor and the Federation, current events and the stench of his uniform told Shar that enthusiasm for such an alliance might be waning, at least in some quarters.<br><br><i>Excellent deductive reasoning, Lieutenant.</i><br><br>Opening his mouth in what he knew would be a futile attempt to put the elder at ease, Shar sensed another presence behind him and turned in time to see another Andorian, a <i>thaan,</i> approaching him from one of the buildings on the other side of the street. Though he was much younger than the merchant, he appeared to be no less irritated by Shar&#x2019;s presence here.<br><br>&#x201c;You heard him,&#x201d; the new arrival said, stepping closer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not welcome here.&#x201d; Shar recognized him as another merchant&#x2014;a restaurateur of some sort, if his memory served. Despite his attempts at self-control, Shar felt muscles tensing as the other Andorian came to the boundary of his personal space.<br><br>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Shar said agreeably, though he had no idea what had happened in the five days since his passage through this area of town to so change the way local residents felt about Starfleet personnel in their midst. Taking a step back, he added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m leaving.&#x201d;<br><br>A tingle in his left antenna made him duck an instant before a chunk of brick sailed past his face and slammed into the wall to his right. The brick shattered on impact, peppering Shar with debris. Flinching from the rain of shrapnel, he turned in the direction from which the projectile had come to see a young <i>zhen</i> standing across the thoroughfare. She glared at him with open contempt, seemingly unrepentant at having nearly injured or killed him. Indeed, her expression seemed to be one of frustration at having failed to do either.<br><br>For the first time, Shar allowed an edge to creep into his voice. &#x201c;I <i>said</i> I was <i>leaving.</i>&#x201d; He bit each word, forcing them between gritted teeth as he glowered at the <i>thaan,</i> who still stood entirely too close for common courtesy.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe we shouldn&#x2019;t let you go,&#x201d; the <i>thaan</i> replied, glowering at him, and for the first time Shar realized other residents were emerging from doorways and alleys between buildings. A low rumble of disapproval emanated from the people as they began coming closer, drawing a circle around him. Training&#x2014;to say nothing of mounting trepidation&#x2014;made Shar scrutinize the threat potential of each new arrival. None appeared to be carrying anything that might be a weapon, but they already had numbers to use against him. A phaser would have gone a long way toward evening the odds, but Shar&#x2019;s weapon was in a locker at the local Starfleet field office.<br><br><i>Tucked away, nice and safe, along with your common sense.</i><br><br>&#x201c;Let him go,&#x201d; a voice said from somewhere behind him. &#x201c;Leave him alone. He&#x2019;s not bothering anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; countered someone else. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t belong here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no better than the looters from the camps!&#x201d; shouted a younger <i>zhen,</i> whom Shar recognized from the long antennae atop his forehead as a Talish.<br><br>&#x201c;Teach him what happens to trespassers!&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes still locked on the <i>thaan</i>&#x2019;s, Shar regarded his adversary. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a fight you&#x2019;re looking for,&#x201d; he said, hoping his words sounded more convincing to the other Andorian&#x2019;s ears than to his own, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more than happy to provide it.&#x201d;<br><br>The <i>thaan</i> leered. &#x201c;You cannot fight us all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Shar conceded, feeling his pulse beginning to pound in his ears as he resigned himself to the situation, &#x201c;but I <i>can</i> kill <i>you</i> first.&#x201d; While he did not want things to deteriorate to that point, it was becoming apparent that he likely would not escape this confrontation unscathed. He would defend himself, and worry about explaining or justifying his actions should he survive the next few minutes.<br><br><i>Always the optimist.</i><br><br>Certain he sensed the <i>thaan</i> readying to strike out at him, Shar took another step back, moving into a defensive stance just as his opponent lunged forward. The other Andorian was sloppy, unschooled in unarmed combat, and Shar easily met the clumsy assault. He blocked the <i>thaan</i>&#x2019;s outstretched arm and with a single fluid motion pivoted on his heel, using his opponent&#x2019;s weight and momentum to carry him over his left hip and flip him down onto the sidewalk&#x2019;s cracked pavement. The <i>thaan</i> landed hard, grunting from the impact, and Shar followed through by grasping the Andorian&#x2019;s right wrist and twisting the arm until the <i>thaan</i> yelped in pain. He tried to break free of the grip, but Shar placed his foot on the restaurateur&#x2019;s throat, holding his arm taut. Seeing other people from the crowd beginning to move forward, he pointed at them with his free hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay back!&#x201d; he shouted. He again twisted his opponent&#x2019;s arm, emphasizing his point as the <i>thaan</i> loosed another anguished cry. Shar sensed movement from his left and ducked just as a clenched fist sliced past his face. Releasing his grip on the <i>thaan</i>&#x2019;s arm, Shar dodged right, scrambling for room as he beheld his new attacker, the Talish who earlier had yelled at him. The <i>shen</i>&#x2019;s features were contorted in rage as he lunged forward, swinging again.<br><br>Moving to defend against the attack, Shar felt hands on his arms just as someone gripped the collar of his uniform tunic. Another hand clamped around the back of his neck and he was pulled backward, off-balance. He jerked and twisted, his body reacting on instinct to free himself. A face appeared near his right side, and he lashed out, striking the attacker&#x2019;s chin. There was a grunt of pain as the assailant staggered away, then a hand grabbed Shar&#x2019;s wrist, arresting any further movement as he was pushed to the street. As he felt the unyielding stones beneath his back, he looked up to see three Andorians holding him down. One of them was the <i>thaan</i> he had first fought, who knelt beside him and thrust a forefinger at his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Traitor,&#x201d; the <i>thaan</i> hissed, glaring at Shar.<br><br>Shar tried to move, but failed. Continuing to struggle against his assailants, he could only offer a look of defiance as the <i>thaan</i> pulled back his hand and formed a fist.<br><br>&#x201c;Release him, and remain where you are!&#x201d;<br><br>The command echoed off the walls of the buildings and cliffs towering overhead, with no easy means to identify its source, followed by short bursts of three electronic tones that commanded instant attention. Only when he heard the low rumble of an engine did Shar know where to look, and he turned to see the familiar form of an aircar, the sort used by the city&#x2019;s police force. It hovered ten meters above the street, its dark, polished hull and sloping, mirrored cockpit windscreen reflecting the rays of the early afternoon sun, and Shar had to squint to shield his eyes from the glare. A row of multi-hued blue lights were affixed to the aircar&#x2019;s roof, and all of them were flashing in rhythmic cadence as the warning tones blared for a second time.<br><br>The effect of the police vehicle&#x2019;s arrival was immediate, with most of the protesters and onlookers dispersing. The three Andorians holding him on the ground released him and began moving away. Within seconds, only Shar remained, and he pulled himself to his feet.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Disperse</i>,&#x201d; a voice called through the police car&#x2019;s intercom system. As the command was given, those few onlookers still watching the proceedings retreated. The vehicle moved closer and descended to the street, maneuvering thrusters guiding it to a soft landing atop the worn pavement. Its engine throttled down to a low idle, and its driver and passenger doors lifted open to reveal a pair of Andorians. Their white hair and the fair blue skin of their faces provided stark contrast to the dark uniforms that encased them from the neck down. Even their hands were shrouded by matching black gloves. Shar noted the insignia on their chests and the holstered weapons on their hips as they strode with purpose toward him.<br><br>&#x201c;Take him into custody,&#x201d; the driver said, pointing to the <i>thaan</i> who stood with the elderly shopkeeper on the far side of the street. &#x201c;Disorderly conduct, assault, inciting a public disturbance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t do anything wrong!&#x201d; a female voice shouted from across the street, and Shar looked to see the woman pointing at him. &#x201c;You saw what he did to him! Why aren&#x2019;t you arresting <i>him</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>Raising his voice for the benefit of everyone else still standing on the nearby sidewalks and watching the proceedings, the sentinel spoke in a deliberate, measured cadence. &#x201c;This incident is over. Leave now, or you&#x2019;ll also be arrested on charges of inciting a public disturbance.&#x201d; He stood watching the remnants of the crowd until he was satisfied that they were heeding his instructions before turning back to Shar. Pausing as he studied Shar&#x2019;s uniform, the sentinel finally asked, &#x201c;Are you all right, Lieutenant?&#x201d;<br><br>Shar nodded. &#x201c;Yes, Officer. Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Indicating the <i>thaan</i> with a nod of his head, the police officer said, &#x201c;I presume you&#x2019;ll want to file a formal complaint against him.&#x201d; His partner was completing the process of taking the <i>thaan</i> into custody.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Shar replied, frowning. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; He paused, regarding the <i>thaan</i> as the other officer escorted him toward the police vehicle. &#x201c;I believe it was a misunderstanding more than anything else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so sure,&#x201d; the sentinel countered, his expression hardening. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a rise in protests against the Starfleet presence in the city.&#x201d;<br><br>Trying not to sound bitter, Shar said, &#x201c;I guess I shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised. There&#x2019;s still so much to do.&#x201d; More than a year after the Borg attack, Andor was still suffering the effects visited not only upon the already beleaguered population but also the planet itself.<br><br>The police officer replied, &#x201c;There also are those who think there&#x2019;s <i>too much</i> being done.&#x201d;<br><br>Unsure how best to proceed, Shar eyed the sentinel. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what you mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I recognize you from the newsnet feeds,&#x201d; the other Andorian replied. &#x201c;You are working with that group of scientists and their alien genome project, trying to improve pregnancy and birth rates.&#x201d;<br><br>Shar saw no point in denying that easily verifiable fact. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he said, nodding. While Federation terraforming specialists already had both short- and long-term plans for healing the widespread environmental damage, the effects of the Borg attack had only exacerbated the reproductive difficulties that had affected the Andorian people for centuries. Ever-shrinking periods of fertility coupled with an imbalance between the different sexes made forming a viable bondgroup problematic, and the situation had only worsened with the horrific population losses at the hands of the Borg.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; the sentinel pressed, &#x201c;you are the one who provided the alien genome that was the basis for the research.&#x201d;<br><br>Again, Shar nodded. &#x201c;Ova, actually. From a species called the Yrythny, which we found during an expedition to the Gamma Quadrant.&#x201d; It had been six years since that mission and the discovery of the Yrythny eggs. The genetic key they possessed, and the hope they carried, had driven Shar to return to Andor and offer his findings to his mentor, Dr. sh&#x2019;Veileth. In short order, the doctor had been able to demonstrate via computer simulations the potential the Yrythny ova held not only to increase the window of Andorian fertility, but also to heighten the potential for multiple births&#x2014;twins or triplets&#x2014;something not seen on Andor in more than a century. Shar and sh&#x2019;Veileth had thought they were bringing wondrous news to their people, but the reactions to the doctor&#x2019;s theories and research had stretched from euphoria to paranoia. For every person who viewed the idea of using the alien DNA to save Andorians from eventual extinction, there seemed to be someone who saw the notion as a means of altering or even supplanting the Andorian species with something altogether different.<br><br>The sentinel reached out and placed a hand on Shar&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;My name is Tolad th&#x2019;Zarithsta.

These cells, later dubbed mirror neurons, responded equally well during the monkey&#x2019;s own motor actions, such as grabbing an object, and while the monkey watched someone else perform similar motor actions. Researchers speculated that the neurons allowed the monkey to understand others by simulating their actions in its own brain. <p>Mirror neurons soon jumped species and took human neuroscience and psychology by storm. In the late 1990s theorists showed how the cells provided an elegantly simple new way to explain the evolution of language, the development of human empathy, and the neural foundation of autism. In the years that followed, a stream of scientific studies implicated mirror neurons in everything from schizophrenia and drug abuse to sexual orientation and contagious yawning.</p><p>In <em>The Myth of Mirror Neurons</em>, neuroscientist Gregory Hickok reexamines the mirror neuron story and finds that it is built on a tenuous foundation&#x2015;a pair of codependent assumptions about mirror neuron activity and human understanding. Drawing on a broad range of observations from work on animal behavior, modern neuroimaging, neurological disorders, and more, Hickok argues that the foundational assumptions fall flat in light of the facts. He then explores alternative explanations of mirror neuron function while illuminating crucial questions about human cognition and brain function: Why do humans imitate so prodigiously? How different are the left and right hemispheres of the brain? Why do we have two visual systems? Do we need to be able to talk to understand speech? What&#x2019;s going wrong in autism? Can humans read minds?</p><p><em>The Myth of Mirror Neurons</em> not only delivers an instructive tale about the course of scientific progress&#x2015;from discovery to theory to revision&#x2015;but also provides deep insights into the organization and function of the human brain and the nature of communication and cognition.</p> 7 illustrations</p><p>Gregory Hickok is a professor of cognitive science at University of California, Irvine, where he directs the Center for Language Science and the Auditory and Language Neuroscience Lab.&#x201c;Every now and again an idea from science escapes from the lab and takes on a life of its own as an explanation for all mysteries, a validation of our deepest yearnings, and irresistible bait for journalists and humanities scholars. Examples include relativity, uncertainty, incompleteness, punctuated equilibrium, plasticity, complexity, epigenetics, and, for much of the twenty-first century, mirror neurons. In this lively, accessible, and eminently sensible analysis, the distinguished cognitive neuroscientist Greg Hickok puts an end to this monkey business by showing that mirror neurons do not, in fact, explain language, empathy, society, and world peace. But this is not a negative expos�&#x2015;the reader of this book will learn a great deal of the contemporary sciences of language, mind, and brain, and will find that the reality is more exciting than the mythology.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven Pinker, author of <em>How the Mind Works</em> and <em>The Blank Slate</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A devastating critique of one of the most oversold ideas in psychology.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gary Marcus, cognitive psychologist and author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Guitar Zero</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book is the scientific analog of a courtroom thriller: against long odds, the brilliant underdog logically, methodically, and with disarming grace and hard facts takes down his fashionable opponent&#x2015;the &#x2018;Mirror Neuron&#x2019; colossus, long the darling of the don&#x2019;t-look-too-closely crew.

When she accidentally falls through the ice while skating, she meets Jimmy. He is handsome, far older than she, and married, but she is entranced. As their relationship unfolds, so too does Katie's awareness of the pain and intensity first love can bring.<br><br>Beautifully written in Berg's irresistible voice, <b>Joy School</b> portrays the soaring happiness of real love, the deep despair one can feel when it goes unrequited, and the stubbornness of hope that will not let us let go. Here also is recognition that love can come in many forms and offer many different things. <b>Joy School</b> illuminates, too, how the things that hurt the most can sometimes teach us the lessons that really matter.<br><br>About <b>Durable Goods</b>, Elizabeth Berg's first novel, Andre Dubus said, "Elizabeth Berg writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, loneliness, love and hope. And the transcendence that redeems." The same will be said of <b>Joy School</b>, Elizabeth Berg's most luminous novel to date.</p><p>Elizabeth Berg's previous novels about the feminine experience in its various stages of girlhood, adolescence, and adulthood have won her a loyal following for their emotional accuracy and powerful voices. In <b>Joy School</b>, Berg's newest book, young Katie's first experience of intense romantic love--with a much older man--becomes not just a crucible for the lessons of love in its various guises, but a rite of passage.<i>Excerpts from reviews of Elizabeth Berg's <b>Joy School</b></i><p>"Elizabeth Berg conjures the ordinary and consequently outrageous life of <br>a twelve-year-old girl in the early '60s in <i>Joy School</i>...[She] <br>perfectly recalls the popular culture of that time...Berg has a way of <br>picking the choicest words for the smallest of events...As always, her <br>style works beautifully--deceptively simple, conversational, and hip."</p><p>--<i>USA Today</i></p><p>"Much to the delight of Elizabeth Berg fans, Katie, the adolescent Army <br>brat at the center of Berg's first novel, Durable Goods, returns as the <br>focus of [<i>Joy School</i>]. In this latest work the author takes great <br>care in exposing the loneliness that trips up her beloved character while <br>also revealing the people and moments that truly do make this awkward age <br>a '<i>Joy School</i>.'... The adolescent internal monologue offered by <br>Berg--with Katie second-guessing herself, fantasizing and exaggerating--is <br>both hilarious and breathtaking. The teacher descriptions alone...deliver <br>a book worth buying."</p><p>--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>"An opalescent...tale...Berg handles Katie's mystification with sweet <br>aplomb, tracking surges with a meteorologist's delight.... The lesson of <br><i>Joy School</i> is not that weeping endureth a night, but that ordinary <br>young humans must learn to endure themselves."</p><p>--<i>Boston Magazine</i></p><p>"Katie is funny, imaginative, irreverent, idiosyncratic, and deeply, <br>unusually charming. She works her charms upon the reader, but perhaps more <br>interesting, she works them upon the other characters in the <br>novel....Though this is a story built around the theme of first <br>love...Berg also manages to show how her narrator is looking for human <br>connection in different ways and in different places. Through all these <br>encounters, we see Katie trying to regain a faith that she lost upon the <br>death of her mother, so that <i>Joy School</i> is, among other things, a <br>meditation on the way early loss can radically shift a child's <br>understanding of the world."</p><p>--<i>The Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"Berg's characters are a treat: Vivid and quirky, they do more than fill <br>in the background. These are people who encourage the reader to imagine <br>what their own stories would be." </p><p>--<i>St. Louis Dispatch</i></p><p>"Berg's stories have a way of making you remember things you never thought <br>you'd forget. She gives us all a voice and company through the trial we <br>face. Her stories are powerful, true, and speak straight to the heart <br>without ignoring the head."</p><p>--<i>Nomad</i></p><p>"Katie's guileless candor delights throughout the novel....One of the best <br>things about this book is how funny it is. Don't read it anywhere you're <br>not willing to risk being caught laughing aloud."</p><p>--<i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i></p><p>As she has demonstrated in previous books, Berg can conjure character with <br>a minimum of words and a rainbow of nuance.

Her first novel, <b>The Shapechanger's Wife</b>, was selected by&nbsp; Locus as the best first fantasy novel of 1995. She has won the William C. Crawford Award for Outstanding New Fantasy Writer, and was twice nominated for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. A graduate of Northwestern University, she has lived in the Midwest most of her life.<b>Chapter One</b><p>Navarr Ardelay's body was laid to rest in a blazing pyre, as befit a <i>sweela</i> man who owed his allegiance to flame. Zoe stood numbly within the circle of mourners, unable to speak, as she watched her father burn away to ashes. Even as he had wasted away for this past quintile, growing thinner, more frail, uncharacteristically querulous with pain, she hadn't really believed he would die. How could there be a world in which Navarr Ardelay did not exist?</p><p>She was so cold that not even the leaping flames could chase away her chill; the weak winter sunlight offered no warmth at all. Doman hovered close, his hand always half-outstretched. Zoe wondered if he thought to catch her when she fainted or to yank her back if she attempted to throw herself into the fire. Doman was the unofficial leader of this little village; he made himself responsible for the well-being of every soul in the small cluster of houses, and he had been tireless in his efforts to ease Navarr's passage out of this life. He had even sent to Chialto for surprisingly effective medicines that would soothe pain and keep the mind clear. Navarr had been awake and lucid as recently as two days ago, continuing to dictate to Zoe how he wanted her to distribute his few items of any worth.</p><p>"Doman must have anything he wants from the house, of course," her father had said late that night. "He will probably choose my desk or fountain."</p><p>That had caused Zoe to look up in surprise. "But I want to keep both of those."</p><p>Navarr had lain back against the pillows, his face thin and drawn, his body weak, but his mind, as always, working working working. "It will be too much trouble to transport them."</p><p>She was even more surprised. "I'm not going anywhere."</p><p>His eyes were closed. "Of course you are. It is time you remembered that you are part of your mother's family as well."</p><p>She had not bothered to answer that because, as soon as he spoke the words, he was asleep again.</p><p>And because she was too astonished.</p><p>He spoke of her mother rarely, and her mother's family not at all. He blamed the powerful Lalindar clan for his fall from grace ten years ago, for the long years of exile and poverty. Zoe didn't even know if her grandmother was still alive, and which of her aunts or uncles or cousins would have inherited Christara Lalindar's title and property if the old woman was dead. Not that she cared. She would not be seeking any of them out, even if the unthinkable happened. Even if her father died. She doubted if any of them remembered her more clearly than she remembered them or thought of her more often.</p><p>This village was her home now, this house the place where she belonged. She already knew, as her father lay there so quietly, that the tiny house would seem enormous once his spirit had flown it. She did not know how she could possibly fill its entire vast emptiness with her own limp and tired soul.</p><br><p>Zoe would have thought her father's body would sustain any flame for a quintile at least his swift, questing, inexhaustible mind should have been fuel for a nineday all by itself but in fact the fire began to die down sooner than she would have thought possible. Most of the villagers had lingered for about fifteen minutes and then drifted away, although three women who had been in love with Navarr at various times still stood weeping around the pyre. Zoe herself was prepared to stand here watching until her legs buckled under her, and then she planned to kneel before the fading embers until the world itself ended.</p><p>But Doman would have none of that. He put his hand on her shoulder, avuncular, insistent. "Come inside now," he said, nudging her away from the circle of stones, back toward the stand of houses. "The fire is almost out. It is time to go in."</p><p>"Not yet," she said, planting her feet.</p><p>He turned his free hand palm up. "It has started to rain," he said. So far the drops were thin and misty, hardly an inconvenience, but the pale sunlight had been blocked out by a slowly building mass of heavy gray clouds, and the air felt like it was gathering itself for a tantrum. "Your father would not want you to be drenched in the tears of the world for his sake."</p><p>Since this was true, she allowed him to turn her away from the pyre and lead her to her small, sad, utterly abandoned house.</p><p>Together they stepped into the <i>kierten</i>, the tiny room set just inside the door. In great houses, Zoe knew, a <i>kierten</i> might be enormous a huge, echoing chamber big enough to accommodate fifty people. A <i>kierten</i> was always completely empty; it was a homeowner's way of saying he was so wealthy he could afford to waste space. Poor villagers could not make such a boast, of course, but none of them were so destitute that they did not have a <i>kierten</i> at their front doors.</p><p>Doman stepped into the main room right behind Zoe, and she glanced swiftly around to see the place through his eyes. She hadn't had much time to clean up the detritus of death, so the room was predictably messy. Bed linens were balled up on the floor, clothes and dishes were scattered across various surfaces, and books and papers were stacked in haphazard piles wherever she had tried to get them out of the way. A faint odor of rotting food drifted in from the only other room in the house the small narrow kitchen that doubled as Zoe's bedroom. She hadn't had time to take her trash to the composting field for at least four days, perhaps longer.</p><p>"Would you like me to send Miela over to help you?" Doman asked. "You know she is a reasonably organized woman."</p><p>It was a small joke, but Zoe found herself incapable of smiling. Doman's wife was magnificently capable. She had raised ten children and served as a great maternal presence to everyone in the village, even Zoe's father, who had been the last man in the world in need of mothering.</p><p>"Thank you, no," Zoe said, speaking with an effort. "If I have something to occupy my hands, perhaps my heart won't hurt quite so much."</p><p>"You must come and spend the night with us, of course," he said.</p><p>Zoe shook her head. "No. Thank you, but no."</p><p>"Then Miela will come here to sleep."</p><p>She shook her head again, but it was reflex. She knew if Doman decided she should not be alone tonight, one way or the other, she would not be alone. Doman was all <i>hunti</i>, all wood, stubborn and immovable. It did not matter how much you leaned against Doman, how many burdens you piled on him; he would not change and he would not break.</p><p>The rain had started to fall with a bleak and heavy steadiness; it was the kind of rain that could go on for days. Even less light spilled in through the small, high windows of frosted glass, so Zoe stepped over a pile of soiled clothing to light a lamp. Instantly the clutter of the room was even more visible.</p><p>She made an indeterminate gesture to indicate the whole room. "My father wanted you to pick something to remember him by," she said. "Anything in the entire house."</p><p>It was a common enough tradition, a way for the living to remember the dead. Doman must have realized that he had been given the supreme honor of being the first to choose among Navarr's possessions, for he nodded once, suitably solemn. He was a tall man, thin and sinewy, with brown-bark skin and thick gray hair, and the colorful overrobe he had worn to the funeral made him look like some kind of oracle.</p><p>"I am happy to bring a piece of Navarr Ardelay into my own home," Doman said. "But I wouldn't want to take anything that you held especially dear."</p><p>"The things I want to keep I have already moved into my room," she said. "Take what you like."</p><p>Doman glanced at the carved desk a huge, ungainly piece of furniture, bought five years ago from a peddler selling a strange assortment of quality merchandise from the back of his wagon. Next he studied the bronze fountain, a miniature replica of the one that played in the <i>kierten</i> of the royal palace. But then he stepped toward the back wall and pointed at the three pieces hanging over the rumpled bed.</p><p>"I would take the random blessings, if you could stand the loss," he said.</p><p>For the first time in four days, Zoe almost smiled. "Doman," she said. "Your trait is wood. And you covet the blessings of a man of fire?"</p><p>He indicated the first item hanging on the wall. It was a square of hammered copper, perhaps five by five inches, with the symbol for courage embossed in it from behind. He had no trouble summoning a smile. "That is a blessing that should fall on a <i>hunti</i> man," he said.</p><p>"True enough," she said.</p><p>"And endurance is a blessing for a <i>torz</i> woman, and Miela is certainly that," Doman added.</p><p>The symbol for endurance was the most beautiful of the three blessings, embroidered in shades of blue on a crisp white background and contained in a frame of carved wood. "Yes, I know Miela has always liked that piece," Zoe said.</p><p>Doman gestured at the third blessing, a stylized symbol vividly painted onto a long narrow bolt of stretched canvas. "And who could not use triumph in his life?" he asked. "I shall be the envy of everyone in the village."</p><p>Triumph was the rarest of the extraordinary blessings everyone knew that and Navarr had always considered it exquisitely ironic that it had been one of the gifts bestowed upon him at birth. Or perhaps the irony had only become clear to him during those last ten years of his life. Certainly, when he was younger, when he lived in Chialto and had the ear of King Vernon, he had been considered one of the most successful men of his generation. Maybe different blessings exerted their power at different points in a person's life, Zoe thought. Triumph had governed Navarr's existence for twenty or thirty years, but it had given way to endurance at the end. Zoe supposed that there had been times during his political career when her father had displayed great courage; thus, in their way, as they always did, the three blessings had proved themselves to be true.</p><p>"I will be happy to think his blessings are now blessing you," Zoe said formally.</p><p>Doman turned to give her a sober inspection. "Although perhaps I should leave them behind to nurture you instead," he replied.</p><p>Zoe shook her head. "I will draw strength from my own blessings," she said, extending her left hand and giving a slight shake to the silver bracelet that held three charms.</p><p>"Beauty, love, and power," Doman said, for of course he had seen the blessings dangling from her wrist every day of the past ten years. "At least one has been true your whole life. Love and power will surely come."</p><p>"Surely," Zoe echoed, though she had never believed it. In fact, she knew the first blessing wasn't true, either. She was tall, thin, and serious, with straight black hair, fierce black eyes, and faintly olive skin that quickly tanned dark in the early days of summer. If she had had to pick an <i>elay</i> trait that described her, she thought she would have claimed honor instead. But no one had any say in their own random blessings.</p><p>"When shall I send Miela to come help you?" Doman asked.</p><p>Zoe glanced around the room, at the piles of clothes and papers and general disarray. For a moment she could not imagine how the whole mess could be reorganized into something tidy and respectable and <i>bearable</i>. She could not imagine how to restructure the house into a place she could live in without her father.</p><p>"I don't know," she said, suddenly too weary to stand. "Later. An hour or two from now. I have to lie down. I have to sleep. Maybe it will all make sense when I wake up."</p><p>Doman crossed to her side and kissed her very gently on her forehead. "Perhaps not today when you wake up," he said. "And perhaps not tomorrow. But soon enough you will heal. It is the way of the world."</p><br><p>As soon as Doman was gone, Zoe curled up on her mat in the kitchen, but despite her exhaustion she remained awake for a long time. Idly, she played with the charms on her bracelet, fingering them one by one. She had always thought there could hardly have been three blessings that suited her less, but she cherished them anyway. Mostly because she loved the tale of how her father had sought them out, inebriated with happiness.</p><p>He had been so excited at her birth so the story went that he could barely wait for her to be five hours old before he rushed out into the crowded streets of Chialto, looking for likely strangers to bestow blessings on his newborn daughter. She had come squalling into the world shortly after midnight, so it was scarcely dawn when the clock struck that fifth hour, and the only people patrolling the street at that time were late drunks, early servants, and women who sold their favors. He had excitedly begged a token from someone in each category.</p><p>The cheerful, dizzy man, who had just stepped out of a tavern, fished in his pocket and pulled out a cheap blessing coin stamped with beauty. "It's the only kind I carry," he confided with a smile. "Every girl deserves to be beautiful."</p><p>The servant, a rushed and unsmiling woman of exceeding plainness, had dutifully stopped and dug through her bag and come up with a bent and dingy coin that held the glyph for love. "We can go to a temple if that's not one you like," she'd said, but Navarr had been delighted to think that his tiny little girl would receive so great a gift.</p><p>It was the prostitute, weary and young, who had fulfilled her role in the traditional way, accompanying Navarr to the nearest temple, where he paid the tithe for both of them to enter. They didn't waste time sitting in one of the five pews, inhaling the incense-heavy air and meditating themselves back into a state of balance. They just stepped up to the big, heavy barrel in the middle of the chamber and plunged their hands deep into its rich bounty of coins.</p><p>The prostitute had pulled up a token first. "One for your daughter," she said, and dropped it into Navarr's hand.</p><p>"Power," he had said, when he had identified the symbol by the murky light. He'd laughed. "It seems like such a heavy blessing for such a tiny creature!"</p><p>"Maybe it will suit her better when she is my age, or yours," she'd replied. She dipped into the barrel again, not as deeply this time, and pulled up a second token. "And one for me," she said. Her voice was wistful when she added, "Wealth. That would be nice."</p><p>Navarr pressed a few quint-golds into her hand. Random blessings were supposed to be freely given, and most people refused payment for the service, but this girl quickly pocketed her bounty. "Did you pull a coin for yourself?" she wanted to know.</p><p>He nodded and showed her. "Change," he said.</p><p>It was a <i>coru</i> trait. "Is your daughter born to a woman of blood, then?" she asked.</p><p>He was laughing again. "Yes, but this blessing is for me, I fear," he said. "An infant in the house changes everything, don't you think? I have been told that my life will never be the same."</p><p>"I hope you come to love her," the prostitute had said.</p><p>"I already do."</p><p>Zoe had heard this story so often she could recite it along with her father by the time she was five years old. Her mother had never seemed quite as amused by the part where Navarr and a woman of the streets ...</p></p><h2>In the Heart of the Country: A Novel</h2><p><b>A story told in prose as feverishly rich as William Faulkner's,<i> In the Heart of the Country</i> is a work of irresistable power.&nbsp;<br><br><b><b>J.M.

As she dreams madly of bloody revenge, Magda&#39;s consciousnes sstarts to drift and the line between fact and the workings of her excited imagination becomes blurred. What follows is the fable of a woman&#39;s passionate, obsessed and violent response to an Africa that will not heed her.Born in Cape Town, South Africa, on February 9, 1940, John Michael Coetzee studied first at Cape Town and later at the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a Ph.D. degree in literature.

Here, after years of meticulous research, Melissa M�ller (<i>Anne Frank: The Biography</i>) and Monika Tatzkow (<i>Nazi Looted Art</i>) present the tragic, compelling stories of 15 Jewish collectors, the dispersal of their extraordinary collections through forced sale and/or confiscation, and the ongoing efforts of their heirs to recover their inheritance. For every victory in the effort to return these works to their rightful heirs, there are daunting defeats and long court battles. This real-life legal thriller follows works by Rembrandt, Klimt, Pissarro, Kandinsky, and others.&nbsp;<br>Praise for <i>Lost Lives, Lost Art:&nbsp;</i><br><br><p></p> &#x201c;A heartbreaking and enthralling story of the brutal and mindless Nazi destruction of a singularly cultivated caste of rich German and Austrian Jews and the pillage of their great art collections: a world that was lost and could never be recreated.&#x201d; ~ Louis Begley<br><br>"Each chapter focuses on a single collector. . . the adulatory profiles [are] matched with an attractive layout and an abundance of well-selected images." ~ <i>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;<br></i><br>"The book is meticulously researched, brilliantly and dispassionately written, and is in all likelihood a game changer in the world of art, art provenance, and art restitution that will resound for years to come."~&nbsp;<i>ForeWord Reviews<br><br></i>"Richly illustrated with excellent art reproductions and family photographs, this is a solid addition to works on Nazi art plundering and the world of art restitution, ownership, and property rights.

Retaining the emotional power of the original, Cond� shows the Caribbean society in the wake of emancipation.</p><p>Set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, Maryse Cond�'s <i>Windward Heights</i> is a retelling of the Emily Bront� classic <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. The title of the novel alone might tell you that something formulaic is afoot--and the book does for the most part mirror the wretched and doomed story of Heathcliff and Cathy. But Cond�'s plan is actually ingenious. She goes beyond Bront�, using shades of human color as a metaphor to illustrate subtle variations on evil, misery, and racism. <p> Heathcliff's counterpart in this story is Razy�, a cold, brutal, and relentless dark-skinned man of questionable origins. We meet him just before his return to the home of his youth--and to his Cathy, who has married a wealthy white creole: "He was dressed all in black in the French fashion, from his tightly-laced leather boots to his felt hat sewn with a large hem stitch. His skin too was black, that shiny black they call Ashanti, and his hair hung in curls like those of an Indian half-caste, the Bata-Zindien. Nobody could hold the gaze of his languishing eyes, where churned who knows what pain and solitude." </p><p> Razy� always destroys what he loves, and as we expect, Cathy soon dies. He avenges her death by punishing everyone near him--his wife, his many children, the entire island of Guadeloupe. Society itself is devoured by his aggression and hatred. This is Razy�'s essence, and Cond� uses him to make her point: the agony of not belonging, of hating oneself because of one's race, is toxic. Though the translation from the French could be more sophisticated, the skill with which Cond� has adapted Bront�'s masterpiece shines through. <i>--Teri Kieffer</i></p><b>Maryse Cond�</b> is the author of <i>I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem, Tree of Life, Crossing the Mangrove, </i>and <i>The Last of the African Kings</i>, among others.

Divided into three sections&#x2015;"Braid," "Fray," and "Nub" (one referent Mackey notes in his stellar Introduction: "the imperial, flailing republic of Nub the United States has become, the shrunken place the earth has become, planet Nub")&#x2015;<em>Splay Anthem</em> weaves together two ongoing serial poems Mackey has been writing for over twenty years, "Song of the Andoumboulou" and "Mu" (though "Mu no more itself / than Andoumboulou").<br><br> In the cosmology of the Dogon of West Africa, the Andoumboulou are progenitor spirits, and the song of the Andoumboulou is a song addressed to the spirits, a funeral song, a song of rebirth. <em>"</em>Mu<em>,"</em> too, splays with meaning: <em>muni</em> bird, Greek <em>muthos</em>, a Sun Ra tune, a continent once thought to have existed in the Pacific. With the vibrancy of a Mira painting, Mackey's poems trace the lost tribe of "we" through waking and dreamtime, through a multitude of geographies, cultures, histories, and musical traditions, as poetry here serves as the intersection of everything, myth's music, spirit lift.</p><p>Nathaniel Mackey (b. 1942), is the author of books of poetry, fiction, and criticism, editor of the Literary Jounal Hambone, and radio show host. His collection, Splay Anthem, won the 2006 National Book Award for Poetry. He is also on the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets, and is Professor of Literature at the University of California at Santa Cruz.Published in installments across several decades, Mackey's two epic series&#x2014;one called Mu, the other Song of the Andoumboulou&#x2014;bring the attitudes of free jazz and the reverberating patterns of West African ensemble music to the goals of the American encyclopedic long poem � la Charles Olson. The mysterious, even hermetic, new verse extends both of Mackey's epics, even (as his prose foreword explains) merging them, so that they form one enormous text describing a mystical quest. Mackey's figures seek the source of inspiration, and his dense stanzas track their uneven progress; "We" pursue it, by foot, train or boat, into realms of fable and myth, via chants, archival and esoteric references, portmanteau words and archeological research. "Atless" (that is, lost without a map) and given to interjections like "wuh," Mackey's crew crosses the "City of Lag" on the "Not Yet Express," as the poet himself sends his spirit "up/ Unreal Street unstrung" in search of new sounds and rituals. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, for the first time, Holocaust survivor Martin Greenfield tells his incredible life story. Taken from his Czechoslovakian home at age fifteen and transported to the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz with his family, Greenfield came face to face with "Angel of Death" Dr. Joseph Mengele and was divided forever from his parents, sisters, and baby brother.<br><br>In haunting, powerful prose, Greenfield remembers his desperation and fear as a teenager alone in the death camp and how an SS soldier's shirt dramatically altered the course of his life. He learned how to sew; and when he began wearing the shirt under his prisoner uniform, he learned that clothes possess great power and could even help save his life.<br><br><i>Measure of a Man</i> is the story of a man who suffered unimaginable horror and emerged with a dream of success. From sweeping floors at a New York clothing factory to founding America&#x2019;s premier custom suit company, Greenfield built a fashion empire. Now 86 years old and working with his sons, Greenfield has dressed the famous and powerful of D.C. and Hollywood, including Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, celebrities Paul Newman, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Jimmy Fallon, and the stars of Martin Scorsese's films.<br><br>Written with soul-baring honesty and, at times, a wry sense of humor, <i>Measure of a Man</i> is a memoir unlike any other one that will inspire hope and renew faith in the resilience of man.</p><p>The first time Martin Greenfield took up needle and thread was at Auschwitz, to mend the shirt of the SS guard who had just beaten him. Today, he is recognized as "America's greatest living tailor," the man who dresses presidents and movie stars.<br><br><i>Measure of a Man</i> is Greenfield's story. More than an unforgettable account of survival and triumph, it's the testimony of a man who came of age amid the darkest evil in modern history but never lost hope.<br><br>The Nazis came for the Jews in Greenfield's Carpathian village in 1944. Separated from his parents and siblings as soon as they arrived at Auschwitz, Martin was the only one of his family to survive the Holocaust. "Where was God?" he asked the rabbi who arrived with Eisenhower's liberating army a year<br>later at Buchenwald.<br><br>Greenfield arrived in America in 1947, nineteen years old and penniless. He went to work as a floor boy at a Brooklyn clothing factory and quickly became a virtuoso tailor, making suits for the president and the biggest names in Hollywood. Within thirty years he owned the firm.<br><br>His insistence on the highest standards, his humility, and his humor have made Martin Greenfield the clothier&#x2014;and inevitably the friend&#x2014;of many of the greatest legends of American politics, entertainment, and sports. He has passed foreign policy advice to Eisenhower on notes tucked into his suit pockets, encouraged a disillusioned Paul Newman on the brink of abandoning his acting career, and coaxed both Bill Clinton and Carmelo Anthony into tails.<br><br>Throughout his long and improbable career, Greenfield has never lost his sense of gratitude for the country that plucked him out of hell and enabled him to build a new home and family. "America is dreams," he writes. "In Yiddish, we have a proverb&#x2014;'Heaven and hell can both be had in this world.' But America is the only place I know that lets you turn your hell into a heaven. It did for me."<br><b>MARTIN GREENFIELD</b> was born in the village of Pavlovo, Czechoslovakia, in 1928.

S. Bach (Vol 1)</h2><p><p>Independent of his international renown as a humanitarian, Albert Schweitzer is well known as a great musicologist; a reputation that rests largely upon this book. Schweitzer's <i>J. S. Bach</i> is one of the great full-length studies of the composer, his life, and his work. Its influence on the subsequent performance of Bach's music was enormous, and there is scarcely a later work on Bach which does not acknowledge a deep debt to Schweitzer's. <i>Grove's Dictionary</i> says of the book, "Schweitzer has probably been more quoted than any authority since Spitta."<br>The first volume contains a virtual history of Protestant church music, examining the role of music in the early Protestant services of many European countries. Frequent allusions to the parallel development of art and poetry, to the leading philosophic and religious concepts of the time, and to events of contemporary history supplement and enrich the text. Narrowing the study to Germany, Schweitzer traces to their roots the forms used by Bach (with particular emphasis on the German chorale and the forms built around it), and assess the contributions of Sch�tz, Sheidt, Buxtehude, Pachelbel, and others of Bach's predecessors. The volume includes a full account of Bach's life, and discusses his works for organ, clavier, strings, and orchestra. Suggestions for performance include sections on bowing, on playing chords and double stops, and on the practice of ornamentation in Bach's time.<br>Volume&nbsp;Two is concerned with Bach's choral music &#x2014; the chorales, cantatas, the <i>Magnificat</i>, the <i>St. Matthew</i> and <i>St. John Passions</i>, the motets, songs, oratorios, and masses. The illuminating analysis of these works, illustrated by hundreds of musical examples, is dominated by Schweitzer's highly original theories regarding Bach's pictorial representation of the text in the music, and the expressive motives Schweitzer has found and identified throughout Bach's compositions. A long concluding chapter makes recommendations for performance on tempo, phrasing, accentuation, dynamics, and on the size and arrangement of the orchestra and choir.<br>Schweitzer's <i>J. S. Bach</i> is among the definitive reference works on Bach and is high on the list of required reading for music students. Yet it is not a difficult or formidable work. It offers a stimulating, well-written narrative, with much in it to interest the music lover as well as the scholar.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Pretending Is Lying</h2><p><b><b>The first book to appear in English by the acclaimed Belgian artist Dominique Goblet, <i>Pretending is Lying</i> is a memoir unlike any other. <br></b></b><br><b><b><br></b></b><br><b><b>WINNER OF THE 2018 SCOTT MONCRIEFF PRIZE FOR TRANSLATION FROM FRENCH<br></b><br></b>In a series of dazzling fragments&#x2014;skipping through time, and from raw, slashing color to delicate black and white&#x2014;Goblet examines the most important relationships in her life: with her partner, Guy Marc; with her daughter, Nikita; and with her parents.<br><br>The result is an unnerving comedy of paternal dysfunction, an achingly ambivalent love story (with asides on Thomas Pynchon and the Beach Boys), and a searing account of childhood trauma&#x2014;a dizzying, unforgettable view of a life in progress and a tour de force of the art of comics.<br><br>This NYRC edition is a hardcover with extra-thick paper, full color throughout, and features new English hand-lettering by the artist.</p><p><b>Dominique Goblet</b> was born in 1967 in Brussels, Belgium, and studied illustration at St. Luke&#x2019;s Institute.

Dominique Goblet's approach is postmodern, with a scruffy, anything-goes mix of styles and moods, but it's marked everywhere by her forays into photography.

Women struggle to balance breadwinning with the bulk of parenting, and stress is constant. Social policies don&#x2019;t help. Of all Western industrialized countries, the United States ranks dead last for supportive work-family policies: No federal paid parental leave. The highest gender wage gap. No minimum standard for vacation and sick days. The highest maternal and child poverty rates. Can American women look to European policies for solutions? <i>Making Motherhood Work</i> draws on interviews that sociologist Caitlyn Collins conducted over five years with 135 middle-class working mothers in Sweden, Germany, Italy, and the United States. She explores how women navigate work and family given the different policy supports available in each country.</p><p>Taking readers into women&#x2019;s homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces, Collins shows that mothers&#x2019; desires and expectations depend heavily on context. In Sweden&#x2015;renowned for its gender-equal policies&#x2015;mothers assume they will receive support from their partners, employers, and the government. In the former East Germany, with its history of mandated employment, mothers don&#x2019;t feel conflicted about working, but some curtail their work hours and ambitions. Mothers in western Germany and Italy, where maternalist values are strong, are stigmatized for pursuing careers. Meanwhile, American working mothers stand apart for their guilt and worry. Policies alone, Collins discovers, cannot solve women&#x2019;s struggles. Easing them will require a deeper understanding of cultural beliefs about gender equality, employment, and motherhood. With women held to unrealistic standards in all four countries, the best solutions demand that we redefine motherhood, work, and family.</p><p><i>Making Motherhood Work</i> vividly demonstrates that women need not accept their work-family conflict as inevitable.</p></p><p><b>Caitlyn Collins</b> is assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis. Her work has been covered by the <i>Atlantic</i>, NPR, and the <i>Washington Post</i>. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri."Ultimately, this book is a rallying cry to value &#x2018;caregiving, as well as the people who provide that care&#x2019;."<b>---Emma Jacobs, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>"<i>Making Motherhood Work . . .</i> surveys the state of affairs in Sweden (long heralded as a bastion of gender equality and a paradise for working moms); the former East Germany (where you see vestiges of a communist system that encouraged mothers to work); western Germany (where culture hasn&#x2019;t caught up with pro-mom policies); Italy (where women seem supported by family and the state but don&#x2019;t feel that way) and the United States (where because we get the least organizational and governmental help, we are 'drowning in stress'). . . . Collins&#x2019;s theme is that, while progressive policies can improve the lives of working mothers, cultural beliefs and narratives must move in tandem. And lawmakers and organizations must beware of unintended consequences; for example, long maternity leaves are nice but also reinforce the idea that women should be primary caregivers."<b>---Allison Beard, <i>Harvard Business Review</i></b><br><br>"Collins, a sociology professor, draws on interviews with working mothers in four different countries in this evenhanded, discerning exploration of work-family balance. Organizing her research by country, Collins finds that balance requires a harmonious confluence of workplace accommodations, government policies, and supportive cultural attitudes. . . . Collins suggests that policies must be passed in packages, rather than piecemeal&#x2015;for example, making sure that daycare is available for children at the age when parental leave ends&#x2015;to be most useful. This study, whose comparative approach illuminates how cultural norms affect policies and economic results, is intelligent, thought-provoking, and clarifying."

Witold Rybczynski and Laurie Olin use a rich collection of illustrations, historic photographs, and narrative to document the creation of this stunning house and landscape. Vizcaya was completed in 1916 as the winter retreat of Chicago industrialist James Deering. The cosmopolitan bachelor, who chose Miami for its warm climate, enlisted the guidance of artist Paul Chalfin, with whom he traveled throughout Italy to survey houses and gardens. With the assistance of architect F. Burrall Hoffman, Jr., and garden designer Diego Suarez, the 180-acre site on Biscayne Bay was transformed into a grand estate, complete with lagoons, canals, citrus groves, a farm village, a yacht harbor, and a 40-room Baroque mansion.</p><p>The lure of this architectural and landscape masterpiece, named for a Spanish Basque province, is undeniable. John Singer Sargent planned a short visit in 1917 but stayed for several months, producing an inspired series of watercolors, many of which are reproduced here for the first time. The book is further enriched by archival material and by the color images of noted photographer Steven Brooke, paying homage to Vizcaya as a lens through which readers learn about architecture, landscape and garden design, interior decoration, and art.</p></p><p>Witold Rybczynski is the Martin and Margy Meyerson Professor of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of many books, including the award-winning biography of Frederick Law Olmsted, A Clearing in the Distance, and the best-selling Home: A Short History of an Idea.

Today, though, Abby would be spared the public humiliation of an Accord sighting, because her father had arrived twenty minutes early for the afternoon pickup.

You either had to know someone&#x2014;several someones&#x2014;to get into Lyman or be able to write a check sizable enough to build a new library. Danny had been fortunate: The foundation his late wife, Sarah, had worked for was endowed by a guy who also happened to be chairman of Lyman&#x2019;s board of trustees.</p><p>Lally Thornton welcomed him to her large, oak-paneled office with a concerned look, clutching his hand in two of hers. Her steel-gray hair was held back with a black velvet headband. She wore a black turtleneck, a double strand of pearls, and perfume with the strong floral smell of urinal cake.

Not everyone can afford it, and, you know, that bothers her.&#x201d; Danny tried to sound casual. As if he were a hedge fund tycoon with a social conscience. Instead of a writer whose advance on his latest book had run out months ago.</p><p>What Lally apparently didn&#x2019;t know was that he was more than a month late with this semester&#x2019;s tuition. He had no idea how he could possibly come up with it&#x2014;let alone five thousand bucks for a trip to Italy on top of that. Lyman had the biggest endowment of any private school in the United States. He was fairly certain they&#x2019;d squeak by a bit longer without his lousy sixteen thousand dollars.</p><p>He imagined her reply: Why, that five-thousand-dollar fee, that&#x2019;s merely a suggestion, a recommendation. Of course it&#x2019;s waived if it&#x2019;s a hardship for any family.</p><p>He felt a single fat bead of sweat trickle down behind his left ear, then down the side of his neck, and under his shirt collar.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that thoughtful of her? Well, you tell Abby that if any of her friends aren&#x2019;t going to Italy because of the money, their parents should say something to Leah Winokur right away. We have scholarships for deserving minorities.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d come here to try and finagle something that might enable Abby to go to Italy. A price break, maybe. A loan. Something. A scholarship for minorities didn&#x2019;t exactly help. The only minority that Abby Goodman, blond-haired and blue-eyed, belonged to at this school was Girls Whose Parents Didn&#x2019;t Have a Summer House. &#x201c;You know, I do wonder whether it might be difficult for other parents, too&#x2014;not minorities but not, you know, the very wealthy. To pay that kind of money on top of everything else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt most Lyman parents would consider that a hardship. After all, no one has to go to Italy.&#x201d;</p><p>With a smile as cold as a pawnbroker&#x2019;s, she said, &#x201c;Was there anything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The halls were crowded with teenage girls. It rang with squeals and shouts and laughter. Some of them walked arm in arm or hugged one another. Danny often marveled at how affectionate girls that age were, and couldn&#x2019;t help contrasting them with teenage boys, who smelled like old gym socks and zit cream and expressed affection by punching one another &nbsp;on the shoulder.</p><p>He waited for Abby with a deep sense of dread.</p><p>Not going on the Italy trip, she&#x2019;d said, would be social death. She&#x2019;d be a pariah. He&#x2019;d told her he&#x2019;d think about it. He&#x2019;d see what he could do.</p><p>Meeting with Lally Thornton had been a desperation move, a Hail Mary pass that didn&#x2019;t complete. No need to let Abby in on just how bad things were. How they were basically living on fumes. He wanted her life to be as normal as possible, given the circumstances.</p><p>She was doing better than a lot of girls her age would have done. She was strong, but her mother&#x2019;s death had hit her hard. For months, her de- fault expression had been a Darth Vader mask of anger. Who could blame her?</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t look forward to giving her the bad news about the one thing she was looking forward to.</p><p>From behind him came a rumbling basso profundo. &#x201c;Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes,&#x201d; sang a school security guard, Leon Chisholm. He was a black man of about sixty with close-cropped white hair and a wide, open face. He wore wire-rimmed glasses and had a gap between his front teeth; the vibe was part professor, part prizefighter. He&#x2019;d spent twenty years with the Boston Police Department, so he was probably able to handle a few mean girls in Lululemon yoga pants.</p><p>&#x201c;Officer,&#x201d; Danny said with a grin and clapped him companionably on the shoulder. When Leon&#x2019;s oldest daughter, Rebecca, had graduated from Bunker Hill Community College&#x2014;the first in the family to go to college&#x2014; Danny had helped her get a job with a publisher in Boston. Leon liked Danny, one of the few Lyman dads who said hi and actually chitchatted with him. To most other Lyman parents, Leon was invisible.</p><p>Then Danny caught a glimpse of Abby near the front lobby&#x2014;her silvery metallic fringed scarf, then her face. Smiling, which surprised him. He couldn&#x2019;t remember when he&#x2019;d last seen her smile. She was walking arm in arm with her new BFF, Jenna Galvin.</p><p>Jenna Galvin seemed to be Abby&#x2019;s polar opposite: She was small and dark-haired and chubby, where Abby was slender and graceful and blond. Jenna seemed sour, aloof, even arrogant, whereas Abby was sweet-natured and sociable. Or had been, anyway, until six months ago. Jenna had just transferred to Lyman as a junior, which was unusually late to start a new school, and had apparently been an outcast there. Abby, empathic as ever, and maybe also a bit rebellious, had felt bad for the new girl and befriended her. Now they were inseparable.</p><p>Abby&#x2019;s face lit up when she saw her father, which was disorienting&#x2014; was she smiling at someone else? She maneuvered nimbly through the teeming horde of girls and threw her arms around him.</p><p>First uncoerced hug in eleven months, Danny thought. But who&#x2019;s counting?</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God, Daddy, thank you!&#x201d;</p><p>For what? he wanted to say.</p><p>She hugged him even harder. He still hadn&#x2019;t gotten used to how tall she&#x2019;d grown. &#x201c;Thank you thank you thank you. I just saw my name on the Italy trip list. I knew you&#x2019;d let me go. You are so awesome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Abby, honey&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna touched her arm. &#x201c;My dad&#x2019;s here, come on.&#x201d; A sleek silver-haired man in an expensive-looking camel-colored suit entered the lobby and gave Jenna a kiss.</p><p>&#x201c;Abby, wait&#x2014;what are you talking about?&#x201d; Danny said.</p><p>But Abby didn&#x2019;t hear him. She&#x2019;d turned around and was talking to</p><p>Jenna. Abby said, &#x201c;I know, right?&#x201d; before turning back to her father. &#x201c;Daddy, is it okay if I go home with Jenna?&#x201d;</p><p>He felt a flash of irritation. She never seemed to want to spend time at home. But he said only, &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;d rather not have to drive out to Weston to pick you up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Esteban will take her home,&#x201d; Jenna said.</p><p>Esteban was the Galvins&#x2019; driver. Jenna&#x2019;s father was some kind of investor and had a lot of money, even by Lyman standards.</p><p>&#x201c;Abby,&#x201d; Danny said, but then someone tapped him on the shoulder. He turned.</p><p>The silver-haired man. Thomas Galvin.</p><p>He appeared to be in his late forties. His blue-gray eyes were like steel against his deep tan. His suit was exquisitely cut, his pale blue shirt perfectly pressed, his tie neatly knotted. Everything in place. Danny&#x2019;s crappy sport coat, which he&#x2019;d bought off the discount rack at the Men&#x2019;s Wearhouse Black Friday sale, felt itchy.</p><p>&#x201c;Just wanted to introduce myself,&#x201d; the man said, offering his hand. &#x201c;Tom Galvin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dan Goodman.&#x201d;</p><p>Abby was already out the front door with Jenna. </p><p>&#x201c;Nice to meet Abby&#x2019;s dad. She&#x2019;s terrific.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most of the time,&#x201d; Danny said with a grin. </p><p>&#x201c;Jenna couldn&#x2019;t ask for a better friend.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s great to meet you, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen, thanks for letting me kick in on that Italy thing.&#x201d; He had the accent of a kid out of Southie.</p><p>&#x201c;Kick in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Abby has been a lifesaver for our Jenna. You have no idea.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hold on a second. You paid for Abby&#x2019;s trip to Italy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For totally selfish reasons, trust me.&#x201d; He lowered his voice to a confidential mutter. &#x201c;This is Jenna&#x2019;s fourth school in three years. She was already begging to leave until she started hanging out with Abby. And she sure as hell doesn&#x2019;t want to go with the class to Italy if Abby&#x2019;s not going.&#x201d; </p><p>Danny&#x2019;s cheeks grew hot. He was astonished, and embarrassed. And angry, though he rarely let anyone see his anger.</p><p>How much had Abby told her friend? She couldn&#x2019;t possibly know how bad their financial situation was, but she must have said something. This was beyond embarrassing; it was demeaning. This rich guy was treating them like a charity case.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s extremely generous of you,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I can&#x2019;t accept it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Please. It&#x2019;s for my daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;ll call the bursar and set them straight. But I really do appreciate the thought.&#x201d; He smiled, then turned and pushed through the front doors.</p><p>The sun dazzled his eyes. A gleaming black Maybach limousine was parked at the curb. It had to belong to Galvin. A man in a uniform of black suit, white shirt, and black tie approached Abby and Jenna with a cardboard Starbucks take-out tray and handed them each a cup. Galvin&#x2019;s chauffeur must have gone on a Starbucks run.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Esteban,&#x201d; Abby said. She turned as Danny emerged, beaming excitedly, her eyes shining. &#x201c;Everything okay, Daddy?&#x201d;</p><p>He beckoned her over. &#x201c;Boogie,&#x201d; he began quietly, using the pet name he never used around anyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh God, I&#x2019;m so so so excited,&#x201d; she interrupted. Then followed a tor- rent of words&#x2014;pasta and gelato and shopping&#x2014;that Danny couldn&#x2019;t quite follow. She grabbed both of his elbows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Italy!&#x201d; she almost sang.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t seen her this happy in years. Dimples had appeared on her cheeks, her smile so wide it looked like her face might crack in two.</p><p>Now what? Tell her there&#x2019;d been a mix-up?</p><p>Danny had once made the mistake of opening a link a friend had sent him. It was something called a crush video. It showed a woman stepping on a tiny kitten with her stiletto heels. It was one of the sickest, most disturbing things he&#x2019;d ever seen, and he wished he could unsee it.</p><p>Telling Abby the Italy trip wasn&#x2019;t going to happen would feel a bit like that.</p><p>&#x201c;Dan,&#x201d; Galvin said by way of greeting as he came out the front door, lowering his BlackBerry.</p><p>Danny approached and said, in a low voice, &#x201c;I can only accept this if you&#x2019;ll let me pay you back.&#x201d;</p><p>Galvin&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up. He nodded solemnly. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll send my goons after you.&#x201d; He gave Danny a wry smile.</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, no offense, but it&#x2019;s a little awkward. We don&#x2019;t even know each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is crazy, right? Given how close Abby and Jenna are? Listen, come over for dinner tomorrow night, wouldja? The boys are home from college, and they love Abby, and Celina is making her famous arroz con pollo.&#x201d;</p><p>What could he say? The guy was shelling out for his daughter&#x2019;s trip to Italy. Dinner with his family was the least he could do.</p><p>Much later, he&#x2019;d replay that moment over and over again in his head. </p><p>He thrust out his hand and smiled. &#x201c;Sounds great,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Danny opened the door of the two-bedroom on Marlborough Street, he was greeted by the loud thumping of a dog&#x2019;s tail against the floor. Rex, their arthritic chocolate Lab, struggled to get up from his bed near the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, buddy, no need to get up for my sake,&#x201d; he said, coaxing Rex back down onto the plaid dog bed, stroking his graying coat, massaging his haunches. Rex was thirteen years old, which was old for the breed. His muzzle had gone silver, his amber eyes clouded with an opaque cataract haze. He&#x2019;d belonged to Sarah, went with her after the divorce, and then had moved in with Abby. The old boy, profligate with affection, had heroically gotten Abby through her mother&#x2019;s death.</p><p>The red message light on Danny&#x2019;s phone was blinking.</p><p>Eight voice mails. Seven from one particularly odious and persistent collections agent named Tony Santangelo of Asset Recovery Solutions, who seemed to have trained at the Bada Bing school of debt collection. His &#x201c;solution&#x201d; was to &#x201c;garnish&#x201d; Danny&#x2019;s wages.</p><p>Garnish. Such a benign-sounding word.

(Loeb Classical Library No. 485) (English and Greek Edition)</h2><p><p>Of the Greek lyric poets, Pindar (ca. 518-438 BCE) was "by far the greatest for the magnificence of his inspiration" in Quintilian's view; Horace judged him "sure to win Apollo's laurels." The esteem of the ancients may help explain why a good portion of his work was carefully preserved. Most of the Greek lyric poets come down to us only in bits and pieces, but nearly a quarter of Pindar's poems survive complete. William H. Race now brings us, in two volumes, a new edition and translation of the four books of victory odes, along with surviving fragments of Pindar's other poems.</p><br><br><p>Like Simonides and Bacchylides, Pindar wrote elaborate odes in honor of prize-winning athletes for public performance by singers, dancers, and musicians. His forty-five victory odes celebrate triumphs in athletic contests at the four great Panhellenic festivals: the Olympic, Pythian (at Delphi), Nemean, and Isthmian games. In these complex poems, Pindar commemorates the achievement of athletes and powerful rulers against the backdrop of divine favor, human failure, heroic legend, and the moral ideals of aristocratic Greek society. Readers have long savored them for their rich poetic language and imagery, moral maxims, and vivid portrayals of sacred myths.</p><br><br><p>Race provides brief introductions to each ode and full explanatory footnotes, offering the reader invaluable guidance to these often difficult poems. His new Loeb Pindar also contains a helpfully annotated edition and translation of significant fragments, including hymns, paeans, dithyrambs, maiden songs, and dirges.</p></p><p><p>William H.

Though their physical weight is inconsequential, everything she carries feels heavy to her. She tries to pull her skirt underneath her, but the wind coming off the bay is relentless, and the cotton billows around her like a parachute.</p><p>She closes her eyes and tries to picture herself being lifted from the deck of the boat, floating above in the cool air and looking down as the vessel moves across the water. Genoa, Rapallo, and the western coast of Italy look like a knife&#x2019;s edge against the water. From the boat, she can see the pale facades of the villas nestled into the cliffs and the century-old hotels that face the sea.</p><p>She has been traveling for days, but it feels like months. With a gray scarf covering her dark hair and her navy blue dress modest and unassuming, she could be any young Italian girl in her early twenties.</p><p>Her stomach is empty. She tries to forget her hunger by scanning her fellow passengers. The boat carries close to thirty people. Seven of them are German soldiers, along with a handful of grandmothers dressed in their widow black. The others are nameless men and women who all appear unremarkable to her.</p><p>Just as she hopes she appears to them.</p><p>Early on in the war, she learned how to lose herself: to appear plain, and not worth stopping in the street. She can&#x2019;t remember the last time she wore a brightly colored dress or her favorite silk blouse, the one with the white flowers. Beauty, she has come to realize, is another weapon, better packed away and revealed only when absolutely needed.</p><p>She instinctively cups her hands on her stomach as the boat approaches the dock. She is surprised to find so many Germans there, as she had believed she was finally on her way to safety. She has spent weeks trying to avoid them, yet now here they are standing at the dock, waiting to check everyone&#x2019;s papers.</p><p>She feels her entire stomach turn. She takes off her rucksack and instinctively clutches it to her chest.</p><p>She stands up, her legs feeling like they may give out from underneath her. She takes her palms to her cheeks and gently presses the skin, so that the pallor of fear is replaced with color.</p><p>Afraid the soldiers might search too deeply inside her rucksack, she withdraws her forged papers and holds them to her side. She walks slowly behind one of the widows whose crucifix is so large, she hopes it might cast off a bit of protection onto her as well&#x2014;or at least temporarily distract the soldiers.</p><p>She walks carefully across the deck until she finally reaches the dock. High on the hill, the white houses look like teeth. She sees bougainvillea roping over terraces and hibiscus flowers opening up like parasols to the sun. She inhales the scent of jasmine, but she is weakening from fear with every step.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Ausweis!</i>&#x201d; The Germans are barking their orders and grabbing papers out of nervous hands.</p><p>Elodie is next in line. Her hand clasps her false papers. A few weeks before, she had destroyed the identity card that bore her real information. Elodie Bertolotti is now Anna Zorzetto.</p><p>Anna. Anna. She tries to concentrate on her new name. Her heart is pounding.</p><p>&#x201c;Next! You!&#x201d; One of the Germans grabs the papers in her hand, his fingers seizing them with such force that their fingers momentarily overlap. She shudders at his touch.</p><p>&#x201c;Name!&#x201d; the German snaps at her. His voice is so sharp, she finds herself momentarily freezing and incapable of uttering even the slightest sound.</p><p>&#x201c;Name!&#x201d;</p><p>Her mouth is now open, but she is like a muted instrument. She begins to stammer when, out of nowhere, a voice shoots through the air.</p><p>&#x201c;Cousin! Cousin!&#x201d; a large, barrel-chested man shouts to her from the crowd that had congregated at the dock.</p><p>&#x201c;Cousin! Thank goodness you&#x2019;ve come. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you for days!&#x201d; The man pushes to the front of the crowd and embraces her.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s with me,&#x201d; he tells the German soldier.</p><p>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take her then,&#x201d; the soldier mutters as he reaches for the papers of the next person in line.</p><p>This man, whom Elodie has never seen before, squeezes her arm tightly and begins steering her through the crowd. He pushes people away so she can walk freely in his path.</p><p>He turns his head toward her and waves his hand in the direction of the hill. &#x201c;This way,&#x201d; he whispers. &#x201c;I live above the port, deep into the cliff.&#x201d;</p><p>She stands for a moment, frozen in her tracks. She can still hear the noises from the harbor: the Germans barking orders, the shouts as people try to locate each other, and the cries from tired children.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not your cousin,&#x201d; she finally says to him. &#x201c;You must be mistaken.&#x201d; She tries to speak slowly and clearly. She notices his speech is more proper than the dialect she heard on the dock. He speaks in an educated tongue. But still, Elodie wants her words to be received without confusion.</p><p>Her scarf has loosened, allowing her face to emerge from a sea of drab cloth. Like water receding to reveal a well-polished stone. Immediately, he is struck by the green of her eyes and the intensity of her gaze. He looks at her without speaking, then finally forms his words. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why? Why did you save me?&#x201d;</p><p>She hears his breath, a whisper of air escaping from his chest.</p><p>&#x201c;Every few months I come here and save one person.&#x201d;</p><p>She looks at him, puzzled. &#x201c;But why did you pick me?&#x201d;</p><p>He studies her face, reaffirming what he already knows.</p><p>&#x201c;Why? It&#x2019;s simple. I choose the person who looks the most afraid.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>Portofino, Italy</p><p>OCTOBER 1943</p><p>He asks if he can carry her rucksack for her. She tells him no. &#x201c;I carry this myself.&#x201d; He does not push her. He cannot read her quite yet. He can only smell the fear on her. To him, it&#x2019;s the scent of a hunted animal. She is restless and suspicious. Her expression does not soften as they walk up the narrow streets toward his house. She focuses her eyes ahead and does not stop once to gaze at the unspoiled beauty of the village or the sea below.</p><p>He alternates from walking in front of her to moments of lagging behind. Sometimes he feels the betrayal of his own body. The swell of his stomach, the shortness of his legs, the foot injury that kept him out of this war. She is steps ahead of him, and he notices the strength of her body. The ribbon of muscle in her calves, the tightness in her hips. The firmness of her arms.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; he tells her.</p><p>She looks back at him and stares. He has seen that look&#x2014;the vulnerable wanting to appear strong&#x2014;countless times over the past year.</p><p>&#x201c;You can trust me,&#x201d; he tells her.</p><p>Again she stares at him. One of the straps of her rucksack slips off her shoulder and she readjusts it.</p><p>&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>She is so tired that &#x201c;Elodie&#x201d; nearly slips from her tongue, but she catches that word before it escapes her. &#x201c;Anna,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Anna Zorzetto.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anna. I am a doctor. The only one here in the village. I promise, you have nothing to fear from me.&#x201d;</p><p>His explanation seems to register with her, but she does not soften in the sunlight. He notices that the exact opposite happens instead, as if her body stiffens with his every word.</p><p>She tries to read him. The look in his eyes, the lines of his face that suggest both a sadness and an earnestness at the same time.</p><p>She turns her head back again, as if to look one more time at the port below. She is desperate to forget the sheer terror she felt only minutes ago, when she feared they might question her papers, or even worse, search her bag.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she finally manages to say, &#x201c;I suppose I will have to trust you. I don&#x2019;t have any choice, do I?&#x201d;</p><p>They walk deeper into the rocky cliffs, climbing a small, narrow path, passing over ancient stone walls that barricade a steep mountainside, before they arrive at a small archway covered in vines. Tucked within the jungle of flowers and thicket is a white house with a heavy door, the wood painted in glossy coats of green. She notices the lemon and fig trees and, again, the perfume of jasmine in the air. She feels dizzy. These are not the trees of her childhood in the north of Italy, with its crisp smell of pine and juniper berries in the air. Here she feels as though she has awakened from a dream. The dialect is foreign. The skin more weathered, the clothes less refined.</p><p>How many days has it been since she has slept deeply? The fatigue inside her is paralyzing, and she is thirsty for sleep. Everything she does seems to require an inordinate amount of energy, compounded by the strain of trying not to appear tired and vulnerable.</p><p>Inside the house, he offers her a glass of water. She drinks it down greedily and he refills the glass. And, then, one more time. He goes into the kitchen and cuts her three pieces of bread. He spoons some honey into a bowl. He removes the stem of a persimmon and quarters it with a knife before scooping out the soft flesh into a saucer.</p><p>She takes only one spoonful of the honey with the bread even though she wants more. She takes only a little of the persimmon. She does not want to reveal the nakedness of her hunger. But the third glass of water, she finishes entirely.</p><p>&#x201c;You are probably tired from your journey,&#x201d; he tells her. &#x201c;I have a spare room, where you can get some rest.&#x201d;</p><p>He walks her to a small room with white walls, painted tiles on the floor, and a window that overlooks the sea. The air billows through the translucent curtains, and the image reminds her of her skirt lifting in the ocean breeze.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I need to sleep,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>He closes the door behind him, and she waits until she hears his footsteps down the hall. She notices the key in the door and turns it, hearing the lock click. Then, knowing she is finally safe, at least for the moment, she lifts up her rucksack to the bed and unpacks it.</p><p>The contents are both what one would expect and what one would not.</p><p>She takes out the first layer. The spare blue dress, her slip, and her underclothes. Then, the sweater from Luca, which she brings to her face and inhales.</p><p>Her heart pounds as she removes the second layer. A small toiletry bag that contains her toothbrush, a bar of soap, and her comb.</p><p>She next comes to her nightgown, then the small pouch with the amulet on a leather cord, which she cups in her hands. But then on the bottom of her rucksack, she withdraws a book, so slender it could be a journal. For a moment, she pauses. She rests her hand on its well-worn cover. Then, slowly and with great reverence, she opens it. Inside this book is another folded piece of paper. But it&#x2019;s not something written in a code that she doesn&#x2019;t understand. Nor is she meant to deliver it as she did during her days as a messenger for the Resistance. Instead, she unfolds it to reveal a sheet of musical score.</p><p>She closes her eyes and hears the song imprinted on it.</p><p>How does one hear music? Is it the rhythm of an unspoken language? An untranslatable code?</p><p>Elodie hears the notes inside her head like the movement of water. It begins in soft ripples. She also hears the notes in color. An ink wash of pale blue, or the glimmer of white stone. Soothing at times, then escalating. Long, interconnected strokes that enter her in a wholly different channel. Not through her mind, but in the deepest cavity of her belly.</p><p>She closes her eyes and remembers her cello back in Verona. The prestigious music school where she carried her instrument every morning, in the black case nearly the same size as she.</p><p>She remembers holding the cello between her legs. Her knees two bookends against the lowest curve, one arm embracing the neck, while the other held the bow. With each stroke of her bow, her body coaxed the instrument into song.</p><p>But now, she merely takes the sheet of music to the bed and folds her hands over the top. She relaxes as the notes float through her. Sleep finally takes over her, until there is nothing but the melody of the notes inside her head.</p><p>Her parents had given her that first instrument when she was seven. For several months prior, she had gone to sleep hearing them discuss which instrument she would study. Her mother had wanted the flute, but her father had pushed for the violin. But Elodie had begged for a cello. She had first become enamored by the instrument&#x2019;s beautiful sound while at a concert at her father&#x2019;s school. The students had played the cello concerto, and she sat there mesmerized.</p><p>On that walk home, she pierced the air with her own imaginary bow. She still heard the music in her head, every note lingering inside her. The dance of that cellist imprinted on every fiber of muscle and piece of bone.</p><p>The day she was finally given her first cello, and the sight of her father placing the dark leather case on their dining room table, were memories that Elodie stored inside her mind, each image like a single note connected to the next. She would never forget the sight as her father unsnapped the case. The instrument had been wrapped in a beautiful red scarf to protect the bow from scratching the varnish, and when her father removed it, Elodie gasped.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a three-quarter size,&#x201d; her father told her as he handed the cello for her to hold. &#x201c;When you get a little older, you&#x2019;ll play on a full size.&#x201d;</p><p>She took the instrument from him and, immediately, Elodie felt her heart begin to race. It was the most beautiful thing she had ever held.</p><p>&#x201c;And the bow, Elodie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her father took out the bow and handed that to her as well.</p><p>&#x201c;She is her father&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201d; Orsina said, sensing that her daughter would have no problem once she learned the necessary techniques. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to hear her play.&#x201d;</p><p>Elodie began her studies slowly, her father adamant that whatever she learned, she would learn correctly. The first thing he taught her was to caress her cello.</p><p>The ideal, he told his young daughter, was not to distort oneself. Instead, one needed to find a natural way to embrace the instrument. &#x201c;You need to become one with it,&#x201d; he told her.</p><p>He took her hands and placed them on the top of the shoulders of the instrument. Then, slowly, he moved Elodie&#x2019;s hands alongside the cello&#x2019;s edges, allowing her to feel every curve.</p><p>The sensation of the wood beneath her palms was soothing. Each part of the instrument&#x2019;s construction evoked its own tactile response: the varnish of the wood, the length of the fingerboard, and the ridges within the scrolled neck.</p><p>Elodie&#x2019;s father showed her how to use her knees to secure the cello&#x2019;s tail into the floor to prevent slipping. He lifted her bow from the table. &#x201c;A cellist holds the bow naturally, not like a violinist,&#x201d; he told her. And then he laughed and did a small pantomime, mimicking the awkward way a violinist gripped his bow, the left fingers rolling slightly, a technique that was used to increase the volume.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, she learned to make notes emerge from her cello. She began to feel her arms transform. No longer did they seem like two unremarkable appendages, but a part of her that had their own unique power. Like a bird&#x2019;s wings, ...</p></p><h2>Way of Perfection for the Laity: A Detailed Explanation of the Discalced Carmelite Third Secular Order Rule</h2><p>All who wear the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel are called to be Carmelites, at least of the Third Order. The author explains: &#x201c;Those who are not specially interested in our Carmelite Tertiaryship, but desire to obtain a knowledge of Carmelite spirituality, are advised to read from chapter xi to chapter xv of this book. By Carmelite spirituality we mean the methods and principles of prayer and the interior life which inspire the lives and counsels of the three great saints, Teresa of Jesus, John of the Cross and Teresa of the Child Jesus. We trust readers will find in those pages in simple language all that is necessary to give them such an appreciation of the spirit of those saints as will make them resolve to take the means to acquire it. This book is devoted to the explanation of those means.&#x201d; Thus this book is dedicated to all of us who should have a Carmelite spirituality, following the great masters, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and Teresa of Lisieux. Chapter 11 begins with this from the Third Order Rule, which applies al all sincere Christians: &#x201c;Tertiaries, following the advice of St. Paul, should be sober and earnest in the practice of piety, and avail themselves of all means calculated to foster it in their souls.&#x201d; The author explains: &#x201c;In the language of the Apostles the word 'sober' has not the restricted meaning it bears in the English language. It rather means a calm." The Apostle then exhorts us to be temperate, deliberate, prudent, gentle and calm in all our actions. Tertiaries can best follow the advice of St. Paul and of their Rule in being sober and earnest in the practice of piety by striving after that active purgation or purification of which we have written in dealing with mental prayer. They will "avail themselves of all means calculated to foster it in their souls" by the greatest fidelity to the various points of their holy Rule, to their vows, vocal and mental prayer, spiritual reading, examination of conscience, hearing of Holy Mass and the frequentation of the Sacraments.&#x201d; We pray this book will help all to acquire the true spirit of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and her humble devotees.</p><p></p><h2>Growing An Inch (Fiction)</h2><p><p>1949 A story about a boy who made a solemn vow and became a man keeping it.</p><p>Saint Paul/Minneapolis - Those unforgettable days after World War II when people turned back to their personal lives with optimism, a time of <i>Fibber McGee and Molly</i>, newsreels, milkmen, boogie-woogie, <i>The Best Years of Our Lives </i>and chrome grilled automobiles.</p><p>Against this evocative backdrop, Staley West composes this heartrending song, bittersweet lyrics that will lift your spirit, touch your heart and leave you humming... wishing it wouldn&#x2019;t end.</p><p>&nbsp;In one fateful moment, Donny Cunningham comes face to face with unthinkable horror, when his live caves in on him.&nbsp; Changed forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; The task of raising his brothers and sister falls to him when his mother dies.&nbsp; A senior at St. Paul Central, he does whatever it takes to keep his family together, while his father leads them ever closer to disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surrounded aby his zany and lionhearted siblings, his fun-loving friends, and hoping to find love and understanding from his high school sweetheart, Donny is caught between the law &#x2013; which has a claim on his young brother &#x2013; and the gangsters &#x2013; who have a claim on his father.&nbsp; This humor and daring and grit, he fights the dragon of regret with an inner courage and strength that belies his physical stature.</p></p><p><p><b>Stanley Gordon West</b> was born in St. Paul, MN and grew up during the Great Depression and the World War II years.&nbsp;He graduated from Central High School in 1950 and attended Macalester College and the University of Minnesota, earning a degree in history and geology in 1955.

Stevens: Maker of Rangeley Favorite Trout and Salmon Flies</h2><p>Carrie Stevens (1882-1970) of Upper Dam, Maine, created some of the most beautiful and enduring streamer patterns ever, including the legendary Gray Ghost, which she designed to catch the giant brook trout and landlocked salmon of the Rangeley Lakes. This long-awaited book is both a history of the woman and the region, as well as a guide to the Stevens method.

A major publishing event and <i>New York Times</i> bestseller in its day, <i>The Triumph of Politics</i> is still startling relevant to the conduct of Washington politics today.</p><p><b>David A. Stockman</b> was elected as a Michigan congressman in 1976, and joined the Reagan White House in 1981 as budget director. During nearly two decades at the Blackstone Group, where he was one of the early partners, and at Heartland Industrial Partners, a firm he founded, Stockman was a private equity investor. Born in Fort Hood, Texas, Stockman now lives in Connecticut. He is the author of <i>The Great Deformation: How Crony Capitalism Corrupted Free Markets and Democracy</i>.This memoir is a bitter review of Stockman's years in the Reagan Administration. It is a book with few heroes and many fools. The author claims naivete as his excuse. Although the narrative is somewhat confusing, overall, its backstage view of policymaking leaves one discouraged, even frightened by the superficiality. The book is a necessary library purchase for two reasons: the notoriety of the book and its author, and the insider's view of key policies still in place and key personalities still in power.

Right in the McDonald&#x2019;s on base. Right in front of . . . A roomful of people who weren&#x2019;t paying either of them the slightest bit of attention.<br><br> Lt. (jg) Teri Howe didn&#x2019;t know whether to be bitterly disappointed or intensely relieved. She took her tray and moved away from Joel, purposefully ignoring him. She headed swiftly to the other side of the room. Evade and conceal. Run and hide. Do not engage the enemy at this time. Don&#x2019;t create a scene.<br><br> She sat at a small table already occupied by a female lieutenant who was deeply engrossed in a book. She glanced up quizzically at all of the other empty tables and then at Teri.<br><br> &#x201c;Ass grabber on my six,&#x201d; Teri explained. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be quiet, I promise. You don&#x2019;t have to stop reading.&#x201d;<br><br> The lieutenant smiled, sympathetic understanding in her eyes. &#x201c;Some of these guys can be relentless in their pursuit. New here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Reserves,&#x201d; Teri said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in between civilian jobs, so I took a short-term active duty assignment.&#x201d; A hundred and twenty days, with a hundred and fourteen to go, dodging Joel Hogan&#x2019;s wandering hands. God. It seemed like a long time, but at least there was an end in sight. It was pathetic, when all she wanted to do was fly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Teri Howe.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Kate Takamoto.&#x201d; The lieutenant nodded, returning to her book, leaving Teri to her lunch.<br><br> Teri opened the wrapper of her sandwich, lifted the bun, and stared at the chicken, her appetite gone. No surprise there. She&#x2019;d been on the Joel Hogan diet for a week now. It was remarkably effective&#x2014;the mere thought of the man turned the taste of food in her mouth into something unmentionable let alone palatable.<br><br> Teri glanced up, saw that Joel had been waylaid by several other officers. He smiled, laughed, his straight white teeth gleaming against the tan of his too-handsome face. His smarmy, smirking, God&#x2019;s-gift-to-all-women face.<br><br> There was a time when she&#x2019;d actually found him attractive. It seemed impossible now, but it was true. There was a time she&#x2019;d actually lusted after the King of Repugnancy. And her youth and stupidity were coming back now to bite her on the butt. Big time.<br><br> Don&#x2019;t touch me. She&#x2019;d already said that to him too many times to count. Don&#x2019;t talk to me, don&#x2019;t look at me, don&#x2019;t even think about me. She hadn&#x2019;t said that. It was a far less reasonable request, considering they were going to work in the same area for the next 114 days.<br><br> God, it made her stomach hurt just to think about it.<br><br> She had to stay out of his way.<br><br> It was the smartest thing to do. She was going to have to stay on her toes, make sure there was always space be- tween them.<br><br> From the corner of her eye, she saw Joel stand up, and she tensed. But he was only going to get milk for his coffee. She forced herself to take another bite of her sandwich and found herself looking straight into Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br> He was sitting with Lieutenant Paoletti and a bunch of the other SEALs from Team Sixteen&#x2019;s Troubleshooter squad, both officers and enlisted. She&#x2019;d worked with them before, and after ferrying them back and forth from a training op out in the desert this past week, she knew all of their nicknames.<br><br> Nilsson was Nils or Johnny. Starrett was called Sam. Jenkins was Jenk, Jacquette was Jazz, and Karmody was known as WildCard. Even the team&#x2019;s commanding officer, Lt. Paoletti, had his name shortened to L.T.<br><br> Everyone had a nickname but Stan Wolchonok, who was never called anything but &#x201c;Senior Chief&#x201d; or &#x201c;Senior,&#x201d; and was always addressed in a most respectful and sometimes even reverent tone.<br><br> He was a scary looking man, not terribly tall but muscular&#x2014;completely ripped, in fact&#x2014;with a face that looked as if he&#x2019;d spent a few years in a boxing ring. His broad cheekbones, big forehead, and heavy brow seemed made for the permanent glower he&#x2019;d perfected. His jawline and chin were pugnacious and his nose listed very slightly to the left&#x2014;broken one too many times, no doubt. His eyes were dark and capable of being cuttingly intense or soullessly flat and dead. His hair had lately outgrown his usual no frills crew cut and was thick and wavy and surprisingly blond. His skin was fair&#x2014;too fair&#x2014;and he was nearly always sun- or wind-burned, with ruddy cheeks and a peeling nose.<br><br> But the respect shown to him by his men and the officers in his SEAL team wasn&#x2019;t because he looked like someone you wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily want to meet in a dark alley. No, he was respected because his men knew that he would fight to the death for them, if it came down to that. No, he would even fight from beyond death for them, because not even death could stop mighty Senior Chief Wolchonok.<br><br> The man was a problem solver. A miracle worker, who expected as much&#x2014;more&#x2014;from himself than he did from his men.<br><br> And as she sat there, Teri found herself staring back at him. His scowling gaze flickered across the restaurant, landing briefly on Joel Hogan.<br><br> Oh, shoot, she&#x2019;d been wrong. She forced herself to look down at her sandwich, feeling her cheeks heat. Someone had seen Joel cop a feel in the food line. Stan Wolchonok had seen.<br><br> God, how humiliating.<br><br> She choked down several more tasteless bites of her sandwich and finished her soda. Gathering up her trash, she said another quick thanks to Kate and headed outside, out of the building and toward the water, hoping that the fresh ocean air would help her regain her steadiness and calm.<br><br> But she heard the door open, as if someone were following her. Please don&#x2019;t let it be the senior chief. Please don&#x2019;t let it be&#x2014;<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Teri, where you going in such a hurry?&#x201d;<br><br> Well, that was a lesson in &#x201c;be careful what you wish for.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t Stan Wolchonok. It was Joel.<br><br> Evade and conceal.<br><br> Keep distance between them.<br><br> Run away.<br><br> Teri put her head down, pretending she hadn&#x2019;t heard him, and kept on walking.<br><br> The April morning should have been glorious. Crisp and clean with a bright blue sky and a breeze that proclaimed spring was finally here.<br><br> Helga Rosen awakened early with the strange sound of airplanes buzzing overhead. Lots and lots of airplanes.<br><br> She lingered in her room until eight, and then, like every other day, she went downstairs for a bowl of Fru Inger Gunvald&#x2019;s porridge, ready to curl up in a warm corner of the kitchen to enjoy her breakfast with a book. If she was lucky, she could get in at least an hour and a half of reading before she had to leave for school.<br><br> And if she was really lucky, Fru Gunvald would have brought her daughter Marte with her and they&#x2019;d play one of Marte&#x2019;s marvelous make-believe games out in the yard.<br><br> Two years older, Marte was Helga&#x2019;s best friend in all the world.<br><br> But this morning Fru Gunvald was late. The kitchen hearth was cold, the room was empty.<br><br> Poppi was still home at this hour, arguing with Hershel.<br><br> Hershel! Helga ran to him. &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br><br> Her brother gave her a swift hug. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been invaded, mouse. The Germans are in Copenhagen. Classes are canceled.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Invaded!&#x201d; she gasped.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t scare the child,&#x201d; her father scolded.<br><br> &#x201c;Someone besides me ought to be frightened.&#x201d; Hershel turned back to her. &#x201c;It happened in less than two hours, Helga. German soldiers came in on a coal ship before dawn. They&#x2019;re everywhere in the city now and the king surrendered with hardly a fight. It&#x2019;s bad news for all Danes.&#x201d; He grimly looked up at their father. &#x201c;Worse for Danish Jews.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Helga, go upstairs to your mother.&#x201d; Poppi&#x2019;s face was turning pink as he glared at Hershel. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk like that in front of her.&#x201d;<br><br> The sound of a wagon clattering out in the yard made them all jump. Helga&#x2019;s heart pounded. She&#x2019;d read accounts of the roundups of Jews in Germany and Poland from underground newspapers Hershel had gotten at university and passed on to her, whispering to hide them from Poppi.<br><br> She ran to the window, but it wasn&#x2019;t Nazis in the yard.

Written for the non-specialist and widely respected by professional planetarians, this book provides a substantive review of the familiar star lore that has developed among the world&#39;s cultures. A classic in astronomy, this book describes the rich body of celestial lore that has developed among the world&#39;s cultures.</p><p>Julius D. W. Staal was born in Batavia, Netherlands East Indies, in 1917 and began his work in planetariums in The Hague, Netherlands. He left the Netherlands during World War II, became a British citizen, worked in the London Planetarium, and was accepted as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, London. In 1960, he joined the staff of the Planetarium of Witswatersrand and the faculty of the University of Rhodesia. Subsequent travels took him back to England, then to the United States, where he open planetariums in New Orleans, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia; and Decatur, Georgia. He passed away in July, 1986."Interest in constellations and their lore has enjoyed a growing vogue. . . .Yet, there remains a need for quality popular works, ones that are comprehensive and well balanced. The New Patterns in the Sky.fills this need admirably. . . . Looking at the current [edition] of The New Patterns in the Sky, I can appreciate what a major effort it was; to cover the subject comprehensively would require a multivolume work.

Is it pride or lack of self-esteem? Do we love ourselves too much or too little? The debate about the human condition has often been framed this way in both theological and psychological circles. Convictions about preaching, teaching, marriage and child rearing, as well as politics, social welfare, business management and the helping professions, more often than not, fall on one side or the other of this divide. With theological and psychological insight Terry D. Cooper provides trenchant analysis of this centuries-long debate and leads us beyond the usual impasse. Humanistic psychology has often regarded traditional Christianity as its archrival in assessing the human condition. Cooper demonstrates how the Christian doctrine of a sinful and fallen humanity sheds light on the human condition which exhibits both pride and self-denigration. Bringing theological insights ranging from Augustine and John Calvin to Reinhold Niebuhr together with the psychological theories of Freud, Jung, Carl Rogers, Gerald May and Karen Horney, Cooper guides readers through the maze of competing claims to a resolution which affirms Christian conviction while critically engaging modern psychological theory. A model of the proper integration of Christian theology and the discipline of psychology, <em>Sin, Pride &amp; Self-Acceptance</em> will be of special help to students and practitioners of psychology, pastoral counseling and clinical psychology.</p><p>Terry D. Cooper (Ed.D., human development counseling, Vanderbilt University; Ph.D., theology and psychotherapy, St. Louis University) is professor of psychology at St. Louis Community College--Meramec and adjunct professor of religious studies at Webster University. He is the author of <em>Sin, Pride &amp; Self-Acceptance</em>."In <em>Sin, Pride and Self-Acceptance,</em> Terry Cooper has managed to provide a lively and fully Christian view of human nature and its limitations that avoids sounding both overly simplistic as well as too academic. He intentionally tills the middle ground between self-love and self-hatred that has often typified theological discourse among evangelicals, and in doing so unearths a view of the self that resonates both with the biblical tradition and with modern psychology. Well researched and clearly written, this book will challenge readers to think deeply about their own self-understanding as part of the spiritual task of knowing and abiding in God." (Trey Buchanan, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychology, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Citing relevant theological and psychological literature <em>Sin, Pride and Self-Acceptance,</em>is an example of integration at its best and should prove to be useful reading in a variety of courses at the Christian college and seminary level. At the same time the book is very practical and offers insight to any Christian confused by the current simplistic and contradictory arguments for either pride or self-contempt as the underlying problem of modern persons. As an unexpected plus, the book adds to an understanding of male-female differences in regards to sin and spirituality." (Jack Balswick, Senior Professor of Sociology and Family Development, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This is a book of uncommon depth. Terry Cooper demonstrates admirable insight into the human condition, drawing upon both theology and psychology in ways that can only enhance our understanding of pride and self-acceptance. Cooper reminds us that pride and low self-esteem can be two sides of the same coin, and in so doing, he offers us a theologically and psychologically informed account of some of the key facets of what it means to be human. " (Mark A. Yarhouse, Psy.D., Associate Professor of Psychology, Regent University)<br><br>"This book gives vital new life to the conversation between psychology and theology. It is a brilliant analysis of the relation of sin and pride, useful to the classroom but relevant as well to pastors and clinicians." (Don S. Browning, author of Religious Thought and the Modern Psychologies)</p><h2>Works for Violin: The Complete Sonatas and Partitas for Unaccompanied Violin and the Six Sonatas for Violin and Clavier</h2><p><p>The renowned Bach-Gesellschaft, founded in 1850 to collect, edit, and publish all the known works of J.

Unfortunately, it has always been a fantastically expensive publication, accessible only in the largest libraries.<br>This book reprints in text directly from the Bach-Gesellschaft editions the following important works for the violin:<br>Sonatas and Partitas for Unaccompanied Violin, Sonata No. 1 in G Minor, Partita No. 2 in D Minor, Partita No. 1 in B Minor, Partita No. 3 in C Major, Sonata No. 2 in A Minor, Partita No. 3 in E Major, Sonatas for Violin and Clavier, No. 1 in B Minor, No. 4 in C Minor, No. 2 in A Major, No. 5 in F Minor, No. 3 in E Major, and No. 6 in G Major.<br>These popular works, basic to the classical violin repertoire, are frequently performed in concert, and numerous recordings are available. The music has been reproduced in a size large enough to be read easily, with large noteheads, wide margins for written notes, fingerings, etc., and on opaque paper with sturdy, sewn bindings.

Exerting a profound influence upon such thinkers as Derrida, Lyotard, Blanchot, and Irigaray, Levinas's work bridges several major gaps in the evolution of continental philosophy&#x2015;between modern and postmodern, phenomenology and poststructuralism, ethics and ontology. He is credited with having spurred a revitalized interest in ethics-based philosophy throughout Europe and America.<br><br><i>Entre Nous</i> (Between Us) is the culmination of Levinas's philosophy. Published in France a few years before his death, it gathers his most important work and reveals the development of his thought over nearly forty years of committed inquiry. Along with several trenchant interviews published here, these essays engage with issues of suffering, love, religion, culture, justice, human rights, and legal theory. Taken together, they constitute a key to Levinas's ideas on the ethical dimensions of otherness.<br><br>Working from the phenomenological method of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, Levinas pushed beyond the limits of their framework to argue that it is ethics, not ontology, that orients philosophy, and that responsibility precedes reasoning. Ethics for Levinas means responsibility in relation to difference. Throughout his work, Levinas returns to the metaphor of the face of the other to discuss how and where responsibility enters our lives and makes philosophy necessary. For Levinas, ethics begins with our face to face interaction with another person&#x2015;seeing that person not as a reflection of one's self, nor as a threat, but as different and greater than self. Levinas moves the reader to recognize the implications of this interaction: our abiding responsibility for the other, and our concern with the other's suffering and death.<br><br>Situated at the crossroads of several philosophical schools and approaches, Levinas's work illuminates a host of critical issues and has found resonances among students and scholars of literature, law, religion, and politics. <i>Entre Nous</i> is at once the apotheosis of his work and an accessible introduction to it. In the end, Levinas's urgent meditations upon the face of the other suggest a new foundation upon which to grasp the nature of good and evil in the tangled skein of our lives.</p><p>Exerting a profound influence upon such thinkers as Derrida, Lyotard, Blanchot, and Irigaray, Levinas's work bridges several major gaps in the evolution of continental philosophy&#x2015;between modern and postmodern, phenomenology and poststructuralism, ethics and ontology.

Von Eschen offers a vivid portrayal of the African diaspora in its international heyday, from the 1945 Manchester Pan-African Congress to early cooperation with the United Nations. Tracing the relationship between transformations in anti-colonial politics and the history of the United States during its emergence as the dominant world power, she challenges bipolar Cold War paradigms. She documents the efforts of African-American political leaders, intellectuals, and journalists who forcefully promoted anti-colonial politics and critiqued U.S. foreign policy. </p><p>The eclipse of anti-colonial politics&#x2015;which Von Eschen traces through African-American responses to the early Cold War, U.S. government prosecution of black American anti-colonial activists, and State Department initiatives in Africa&#x2015;marked a change in the very meaning of race and racism in America from historical and international issues to psychological and domestic ones. She concludes that the collision of anti-colonialism with Cold War liberalism illuminates conflicts central to the reshaping of America; the definition of political, economic, and civil rights; and the question of who, in America and across the globe, is to have access to these rights.</p></p><p>&#39;Race Against Empire&#39; tells the poignant story of a popular movement and its precipitate decline with the onset of the Cold War.<p>Penny M.

The Northwest region entered an arid phase, and erosion coupled with tectonic events played havoc with river courses. One of them disappeared. Celebrated as Sarasvati in the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata, this river was rediscovered in the early nineteenth century through topographic explorations by British officials. Recently, geological and climatological studies have probed its evolution and disappearance, while satellite imagery has traced the river s buried courses and isotope analyses have dated ancient waters still stored under the Thar Desert. In the same Northwest, the subcontinent s first urban society the Indus civilization flourished and declined. But it was not watered by the Indus alone: since Aurel Stein s expedition in the 1940s, hundreds of Harappan sites have been identified in the now dry Sarasvati s basin. The rich Harappan legacy in technologies, arts and culture sowed the seeds of Indian civilization as we know it now. Drawing from recent research in a wide range of disciplines, this book discusses differing viewpoints and proposes a harmonious synthesis a fascinating tale of exploration that brings to life the vital role the lost river of the Indian desert played before its waters gurgled to a stop.</p><p>Born in France in 1956, Michel Danino has lived in India since the age of twenty-one, studying Indian civilization and culture.

It integrates such topics as the political culture, the experiences of training, the actual Vietnam experience, and the &#39;homecoming&#39;, and offers a remarkable overview of the 870,000 &#39;grunts&#39; who bore the brunt of the fighting in the jungles and highlands of South Vietnam, and eventually Cambodia and Laos.The book addresses many of the stereotypes of the Vietnam combat veteran that have been perpertrated in popular culture, and also considers how Vietnam veterans have been commemorated through memorials and other means, and how the veterans remember each other. The coverage also includes women who served in or near the front lines as well as on the home front. The author draws on memoirs and oral histories including his personal interviews with veterans, but the book conveys a picture of the Vietnam combat soldier&#39;s experience far more powerful than what individual memoirs can provide.</p><p>&#34;A monument to the Vietnam veteran.

Coe, the noted Mayanist, and Mark Van Stone, an accomplished calligrapher, have made the difficult, often mysterious script accessible to the nonspecialist.

For the second edition, the authors have taken the latest research and breakthroughs into account, adding glyphs, updating captions, and reinterpreting or expanding upon earlier decipherments.<br><br> After an introductory discussion of Maya culture and history and the nature of the Maya script, the authors introduce the glyphs in a series of chapters that elaborate on topics such as the intricate calendar, warfare, royal lives and rituals, politics, dynastic names, ceramics, relationships, and the supernatural world.

To remedy this, anthropologist Coe (Breaking the Maya Code) and calligrapher Van Stone have put together this illustrated manual. After an introductory chapter on Mayan history and culture, an overview is given of Mayan script, phonetics, and morphology, which readers need to study carefully with the help of the syllabary and lexicon provided in the appendix. The authors then go on to introduce glyphs, elaborating on subjects like time, the Mayan calendar, royalty, places, titles, relationships, warfare, scribes and artists, ceramic texts, religion, and nature. Also provided are exercises, a discussion of formulae and tables for calendrical calculations, references to software programs, and suggestions for further study. Although no previous knowledge of Mayan culture or language is assumed, this is not a simple primer to take on a trip to the Yucat n. Some background reading, especially on the Mayan calendar and Mayan history, is needed to benefit fully from this manual. For academic and large public libraries. Lucille M.

Eleven years, $7 billion in assets, and 128 branches (or " bank stores" in Umpqua lingo) later, the moniker seems quite apt. Other banks scratched their heads when Davis sent his tellers to Ritz-Carlton to learn customer service and were intrigued when he hired a cutting-edge design firm to completely re-think retail layout. Now, with a top design award under their belt, a name change (there never was a <i>North</i>&nbsp;Umpqua bank), and a completely new definition of the banking business, Umpqua has become the darling of the entrepreneurial press and a growth powerhouse.

It charts the growth of the Quaker movement through the 1650s and 1660s, its different theological emphasis in the eighteenth century, and the schisms of the nineteenth century which resulted in the range of Quaker traditions found around the world today. The book focuses in particular on notions of &#39;endtime&#39;, &#39;spiritual intimacy&#39;, and what counts as &#39;the world&#39; as key areas of theological change. The second half of the book uses extracts from Quaker texts to highlight differences in belief and approach between the different traditions and analyses their future prospects. The book is generously illustrated and includes numerous diagrams to help the reader.

Covering the origins of apocalypticism from Hebrew prophecy through antiquity and early Christianity to its medieval revival in Joachim of Fiore, Taubes reveals its later secularized forms in Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Kierkegaard. His aim is to show the lasting influence of revolutionary, messianic teleology on Western philosophy, history, and politics. </p> <p>Combining painstaking scholarship with an unmatched scope of reference, Taubes takes a comprehensive approach to the twin focuses of political theology and philosophy of history. He argues that acceptance of the idea that time will one day come to an end has profound implications for political thought. If natural time is experienced as an eternal cycle of events, "history" is the realm of time in which human actions can make decisions to alter the progression of events. This philosophy asks that individuals take responsibility for their own actions and resist authority that claims to act on their behalf. Whereas universal history is written by the victors, the messianic or apocalyptic event enters history and gives a voice to the oppressed.</p></p><p>One of the great Jewish intellectuals of the twentieth century, Jacob Taubes (1923&#x2013;1987) was a rabbi, philosopher of religion, and scholar of Judaism. A charismatic speaker and great polemicist, he is often said to have had his greatest impact as a teacher, but his published oeuvre is increasingly becoming of interest. Stanford published a translation of his <i>Political Theology of Paul</i> in 2004."Taubes's 1947 dissertation <i>Occidental Eschatology</i>&#x2015;wonderfully translated and introduced by David Ratmoko . . . demonstrate[s] the relevance of intellectual history and continental philosophy to the contemporary understanding of our theo-politicized world. In addition, [it] show[s] why only a Jew, or more&#x2015;a German-speaking Jew&#x2015;could stand at the most horrible crossroad of modern civilization shortly after the end of World War II, and teach ancient knowledge and erudition as a way to move forward beyond any simplistic solution or closure, be it nationalism, religious identity, or any social role." (Nitzan Lebovic <i><i>H-Judaic</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Occidental Eschatology</i> is not strictly an essay in the history of ideas, even if it advances daring hypotheses about the origins and development of 19th century philosophical thought. Its focus is interpretative more than historical or philological; it is more a contribution towards a new philosophy of history than a reconstruction of the past."

They stared back with their weird eyes, then returned to pulling out clumps of hay from the bale.</p><p>&#x201c;I know, food is more interesting than I am,&#x201d; Meg said. Still, she kept watching, mostly because she could: for the first time in the past few months, she had the leisure to pursue unimportant things, like goat-watching. The harvest from her orchard was almost complete, with only a few apples lingering on the trees now in November. She&#x2019;d put in plenty of hours picking apples alongside her hired pickers and her orchard manager, Bree, and now she gave herself the right to take a break. She was management, wasn&#x2019;t she? Not that the goats seemed to care, as long as their food showed up on time.</p><p>But after a few more minutes, she was feeling the chill in the autumn air. A cup of coffee sounded good. Meg turned around to head for her kitchen door&#x2014;and came face-to-face with an unfamiliar creature. Its head was about five feet off the ground, and it was covered with fuzzy wool. Not a sheep&#x2014;she would recognize that, and besides, its neck was too long. Short ears, doe-like eyes. It regarded her steadily, checking her out much as she was checking it out.</p><p>&#x201c;Seth?&#x201d; she called out. The last time she&#x2019;d seen her fianc�, Seth Chapin, he&#x2019;d gone up the stairs to his office over the shed at the back end of the driveway. Of course, if the windows were shut he probably couldn&#x2019;t hear her. At the sound of her voice, the animal had taken a startled step backward, but it was still staring at her. &#x201c;Seth?&#x201d; she called a bit more loudly.</p><p>She heard a window opening, and Seth stuck his head out. &#x201c;You want something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, we have company?&#x201d; she told him, waving her hand at Large Fuzzy Creature. Creature had turned its head toward Seth at the sound of his voice, but now returned to its steady contemplation of Meg.</p><p>She could have sworn that Seth smiled, but all he said was, &#x201c;Be right down.&#x201d; She heard the window shut again. The goats had come over to the fence line and were now doing their own checking out of the newcomer, who showed no particular interest in them. He&#x2014;or she?&#x2014;seemed to prefer Meg. She thought briefly about trying to shoo it away, but it didn&#x2019;t look hostile, or seem afraid of humans, and she wasn&#x2019;t sure where it belonged or which way it would go.</p><p>Seth came up behind her, now definitely smiling. &#x201c;Oh, I forgot to tell you&#x2014;we have new neighbors. This is one of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you did forget to mention that. First of all, what is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an alpaca.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What I know about alpacas might fill an index card. Don&#x2019;t they produce yarn?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m told. I can&#x2019;t speak from experience.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Alpaca, nice to meet you,&#x201d; Meg said, in the interest of interspecies friendship. &#x201c;I assume the alpaca didn&#x2019;t sign a lease or take out a mortgage?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, that would be the Gardners. They retired from city jobs and decided to find a place in the country and raise alpacas. They bought a chunk of land up toward Amherst&#x2014;it&#x2019;s too steep for most farmers to bother with, but apparently alpacas like hills, at least sometimes. I think they originated in Peru&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where the Andes are, if you recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Should we tell the Gardners that one of their, uh, flock is here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably&#x2014;and I think it&#x2019;s called a herd. They aren&#x2019;t supposed to roam around. I&#x2019;m pretty sure there&#x2019;s a town ordinance about livestock getting loose, although I can&#x2019;t remember if it says anything specific about alpacas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A phone number for the Gardners would help, Seth, unless you want to make friends with this fine specimen of alpaca here. Although I think it likes me better than you, but I wouldn&#x2019;t want Dorcas and Isabel to get jealous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve probably got it in my office&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll be just a sec.&#x201d; With that he turned and walked quickly toward the stairs to his office, leaving Meg face-to-face with the alpaca, who did not seem at all disconcerted. At least it wasn&#x2019;t a bull or something large and hostile. &#x201c;I wish I knew your name. How&#x2019;d you get loose, anyway? I bet your people miss you. And your friends.&#x201d; How many alpacas were there in the herd? Meg wondered.</p><p>The alpaca appeared to become bored with Meg, and wandered over to the goat pen, where the animals exchanged tentative sniffs across the fence. At least they weren&#x2019;t fighting.</p><p>Seth reappeared quickly. &#x201c;Someone is on the way. Their place is only a couple of miles from here, as the crow flies. Or, in this case, as the alpaca&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? Lopes? Trots? Shambles?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take your pick. I&#x2019;d offer you some coffee or something, but I don&#x2019;t want this lovely creature to get into any trouble or wander off. I don&#x2019;t know anything about their habits, and I&#x2019;d hate to see it end up in front of a car on the road. It seems kind of trusting.&#x201d; Meg eyed the animal&#x2019;s shaggy fur. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to pet it, but I&#x2019;m not sure it would be happy about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better not to, for now. We can ask its owner if it&#x2019;s friendly. Although I see what you mean&#x2014;you kind of want to bury your fingers in the fur.&#x201d;</p><p>Only a few minutes had passed when a battered car towing a small animal trailer crept into Meg&#x2019;s driveway. A large woman with short, silvery hair climbed out. &#x201c;Sorry, sorry&#x2014;I hope she didn&#x2019;t cause you any trouble. Lulu, get your hairy butt over here!&#x201d; The alpaca just stared at her. &#x201c;Well, it was worth a try&#x2014;they seldom come when called, unless there&#x2019;s food involved. I&#x2019;ve got a bridle. Mind opening the back gate on the carrier, Seth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No problem, Patty.&#x201d; Seth walked over and opened the gate, while the woman sweet-talked Lulu the alpaca while slipping the bridle over her head. Meg almost giggled, because it looked like the alpaca gave a small sigh of regret at losing her short-lived freedom.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, baby, be a good girl,&#x201d; the older woman said, leading the animal to the carrier. It walked in peacefully enough, and the woman secured the gate behind it, checking it twice. Then she came back to where Seth and Meg were standing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry about that. Oh, I&#x2019;m Patty Gardner&#x2014;I just moved in a couple of weeks ago, a mile or two north of here. You must be Meg&#x2014;Seth&#x2019;s mentioned you. Our house is in pretty good shape, and there&#x2019;s some okay pasture, but the fences leave a lot to be desired, and we haven&#x2019;t had time to make the full circuit and patch them. But I didn&#x2019;t mean to barge in on you like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it, please. Yes, I&#x2019;m Meg Corey&#x2014;I live here, and I have an orchard up the hill, as you can see. I haven&#x2019;t even been here two years myself. I&#x2019;d ask you in for coffee or tea, but I&#x2019;m guessing you want to get Lulu home again?&#x201d;</p><p>Patty smiled. &#x201c;Yes, I do, and I need to figure out where she broke through the fence and if any of her pals followed her&#x2014;I could be chasing alpacas all night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many do you have?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fifteen at the moment. It&#x2019;s a small herd by most standards&#x2014;what they call a foundation herd. We&#x2019;re pretty new at this, so we&#x2019;re starting small, but we&#x2019;ll be breeding them. We want to expand once we get the hang of it, and get some more of the pasture fenced in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why alpacas, if you don&#x2019;t mind my asking?&#x201d; Meg said. Seth had said the woman was retired, but she looked strong enough to handle an alpaca.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re not too big&#x2014;Lulu here is full-grown&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re sociable, at least with each other. They can look after themselves. They&#x2019;re pretty quiet, except they hum now and then. They don&#x2019;t eat too much. And there&#x2019;s a market for their wool. And I should warn you&#x2014;they spit, mostly at each other, but sometimes at people. It can be kind of nasty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it. So if I see another alpaca wander by, I should call you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only herder around, as far as I know. Right, Seth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At least within town limits. You&#x2019;re breaking new ground here, Patty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Beats wrangling government regulations&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve had my fill of that.&#x201d; Patty turned to Meg. &#x201c;Can I get a rain check on that coffee? I&#x2019;d like to get to know my neighbors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. My harvest is almost over, and now all I have to worry about is planning our wedding, which is less than a month away. Right, Seth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d; Seth smiled. Meg smiled back.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I guess congratulations are in order. Look, I&#x2019;d better get Lulu back and hope she doesn&#x2019;t tell all her herd buddies how much fun it is out here. Thanks for snagging her. See you later, I hope.&#x201d; Patty strode off to her car, carefully maneuvered the trailer behind until she was pointed toward the road, then pulled away. Meg and Seth watched them go.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that was fun,&#x201d; Meg said when they were out of sight. &#x201c;Is it just me, or is an alpaca a supremely silly-looking creature?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What, you&#x2019;re judging solely on appearance?&#x201d; Seth exclaimed in mock horror. &#x201c;As Patty informed us, they&#x2019;re fairly nice animals. You&#x2019;ve been lucky with Dorcas and Isabel, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have, although I don&#x2019;t think goats and alpacas are related. But I stand corrected: I will reserve judgment about the nature of alpacas, especially since now I have to live with them as neighbors. Can we go inside now? I&#x2019;m freezing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shoot, I was hoping to get something done this afternoon. Never does seem to work out that way, does it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not often enough. But the alpaca invasion was not my fault. If anything, it&#x2019;s yours. Doesn&#x2019;t Granford have a fence-walker or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not for the past couple of centuries. I vote for coffee&#x2014;I think you&#x2019;re turning blue.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not my best color,&#x201d; Meg said, leading the way into the kitchen. Once inside, she shucked off her coat and set about boiling water. &#x201c;Would you rather have tea?&#x201d; she asked Seth.</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee&#x2019;s good. Where&#x2019;s Bree?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still up the hill, I think. But we&#x2019;re down to the last couple of varieties. Maybe she&#x2019;s hiding out just to avoid the paperwork. She owes me the year-end summary, or at least an estimate. Maybe it&#x2019;s bad news and she doesn&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can sympathize&#x2014;I hate the paperwork part of my business, but if I don&#x2019;t send invoices, I don&#x2019;t get paid. Where are we on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, everything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;East of nowhere, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d; Meg poured water over coffee grounds. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve asked Christopher to officiate, but I don&#x2019;t know if he&#x2019;s done anything about getting the special license, and I&#x2019;m not sure how long that takes.&#x201d; Christopher was a professor at the nearby University of Massachusetts campus and had managed the orchard, mainly as a teaching tool, before she had shown up and decided to take it on. And he&#x2019;d recommended Bree, for which she would be forever grateful to him. &#x201c;I told Nicky and Brian to hold the date at the restaurant, but we haven&#x2019;t talked about food or drink or even set the time. You and I need to get our own paperwork in order, for the state. Have you decided what to do about a best man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I figure it&#x2019;s got to be Art.&#x201d;</p><p>Meg filled two mugs with coffee and brought them to the kitchen table. She sat down with a sigh of relief. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine with me, although of course it&#x2019;s your choice. And if anything goes wrong, we&#x2019;ll have the law on hand to handle it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heaven forbid. What about you?&#x201d; Seth asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Maid of honor? Or matron? Normally I&#x2019;d ask Rachel, but either she&#x2019;ll be about to pop with the baby, or she&#x2019;ll be exhausted from dealing with a newborn. Of course she and her family are invited, but I&#x2019;ll leave it up to her to decide whether she can face coming and how long to stay. So that kind of leaves Gail, who&#x2019;s the best friend I&#x2019;ve got around here. Do you know, I&#x2019;ve probably spent more time with her than almost anyone else in Granford? Except you, of course. But I haven&#x2019;t asked her yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like Gail. See? We&#x2019;ve made a pair of decisions already: Art and Gail. You know, it&#x2019;s a wonder we ever managed to get invitations sent out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t remind me,&#x201d; Meg said fervently. &#x201c;I cringe every time I go into town, worrying that I forgot to invite someone. But the restaurant holds only so many people safely. Anyway, it&#x2019;s your fault&#x2014;you grew up here, and you know everybody in town. I think my own list had about ten names on it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll understand, I&#x2019;m sure. If it turns out that the other half of the population of Granford is miffed at us, then we&#x2019;ll just have to throw another party. Maybe a solstice party.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can plan that one,&#x201d; Meg said. &#x201c;But I guess we&#x2019;re making progress. I&#x2019;ve alerted my parents, but we haven&#x2019;t pinned down when they&#x2019;re going to arrive. I&#x2019;d really rather they didn&#x2019;t stay here. Oh, and we need rings, don&#x2019;t we? And I have no idea what I&#x2019;m wearing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About them staying here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Seth began slowly.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want them to? Or you do?&#x201d; Meg protested before he could finish. She wasn&#x2019;t sure which answer she wanted to hear.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m happy to have them. But I&#x2019;m guessing that one reason you don&#x2019;t want to put them up is because of the bathroom situation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be right. The one bath is barely adequate for the three of us, and I can&#x2019;t imagine adding two more people to the mix. Why do you bring that up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want to give you something special as a wedding present, and I thought maybe an overhaul of the plumbing of this place would be good. Are you horrified?&#x201d; Seth looked uncharacteristically uncertain.</p><p>Meg was momentarily speechless, and then she burst out laughing. &#x201c;I love it! Nothing says true love like plumbing.&#x201d; Seth looked bewildered, as if unsure of what she was saying, so she took pity on him. &#x201c;Seriously, Seth, I think it&#x2019;s a terrific idea. What did you have in mind?&#x201d; <i>And when will you find the time?</i> Meg added to herself.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking that I could carve out a smaller bath from that niche in the master bedroom&#x2014;shower only&#x2014;without taking anything away from the main bathroom. Although all the pipes there definitely need to be replaced. And if I&#x2019;m going to have things opened up anyway, I thought I could add a powder room directly beneath it at the same time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be amazing, Seth,&#x201d; Meg said, and meant it. &#x201c;But we will have one functional bathroom throughout the whole construction process, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. And everything that shows will be historically accurate, at least on the surface. I figured you&#x2019;d want some say in picking out the fixtures. Whenever you have the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love the way you think, Seth Chapin. I think it&#x2019;s a brilliant idea. And I have no idea how I&#x2019;m going to match it.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, clearly pleased by the success of his suggestion. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. This is kind of a shared gift anyway&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll be happy not to have to fight either you or Bree for time at the mirror while I&#x2019;m trying to shave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t dared ask Bree what she wants to do about living arrangements. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d rather not intrude in our newlywed bliss, but I can&#x2019;t afford to pay her enough to rent someplace nearby. Or at least, I don&#x2019;t think I can. I won&#x2019;t know until after she&#x2019;s run the numbers for our sales and expenses. Are we really supposed to figure all this out in the next couple of weeks? Oh, and by the way, are we planning a honeymoon?&#x201d;</p><p>Seth looked stricken. &#x201c;Do you want one?&#x201d; he said anxiously.</p><p>Meg burst out laughing at the look on his face. &#x201c;If you could s...</p></p><h2>Wicked Fix: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery</h2><p><b>Do-it-yourself killer fixes small-town thug . . .</b><br><br> For ex-Wall Streeter Jacobia Tiptree and her teenaged son, Sam, September promises tranquil days winter-proofing their rambling handyman's special of a home in Eastport, Maine.

By following such stories across three centuries, this book explores local knowledge, colonial encounters, and environmental change.<br><br><i>Do Glaciers Listen?</i> examines conflicting depictions of glaciers to show how natural and social histories are entangled. During late stages of the Little Ice Age, significant geophysical changes coincided with dramatic social upheaval in the Saint Elias Mountains. European visitors brought conceptions of Nature as sublime, as spiritual, or as a resource for human progress. They saw glaciers as inanimate, subject to empirical investigation and measurement. Aboriginal responses were strikingly different. From their perspectives, glaciers were sentient, animate, and quick to respond to human behaviour. In each case, experiences and ideas surrounding glaciers were incorporated into interpretations of social relations.<br><br>Focusing on these contrasting views, Julie Cruikshank demonstrates how local knowledge is produced, rather than &#x201c;discovered,&#x201d; through such encounters, and how oral histories conjoin social and biophysical processes. She traces how divergent views continue to weave through contemporary debates about protected areas, parks and the new World Heritage site that encompasses the area where Alaska, British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory now meet. Students and scholars of Native studies and anthropology as well as readers interested in northern studies and colonial encounters will find <i>Do Glaciers Listen?</i> a fascinating read and a rich addition to circumpolar literature.<br>Winner of the Victor Turner Prize for Ethnographic Writing, 2006</p><p><b>Julie Cruikshank </b>is professor emerita in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of British Columbia. She is the author of <i>Life Lived Like a Story</i> (winner of the 1992 MacDonald Prize); <i>Reading Voices</i>; and <i>The Social Life of Stories.</i>"<i>Do Glaciers Listen?</i> is an exploration of nature and culture in encounter that builds upon Julie Cruikshank&#x2019;s deep and unrivalled knowledge of indigenous tradition. It focuses on an area that is, by most people&#x2019;s reckoning, &#x2018;off the beaten track&#x2019; and probably thus, by extension, unpropitious space for such an inquiry. But this is its triumph. It brings liminal space to the very centre of several important concerns of contemporary scholarship."&#x2015;Graeme Wynn, Department of Geography, University of British Columbia</p><h2>Truth Unchanged, Unchanging</h2><p>What is man? What is wrong with the human race? Unless we answer these questions correctly, we cannot hope to solve the problems in our world--problems such as crime, exploitation, greed, poverty, pollution, and war. Obviously those who shape social policy today are offering the wrong answers. In this masterful apologetic for the gospel, Dr. Lloyd-Jones exposes these flaws in modern thinking, especially in the &#34;scientific approach.&#34; &#34;It is a poor physician who treats the symptoms and complications only and ignores the disease&#34; says the author. In this volume we see a doctor, as skillful spiritually as he was medically, make a penetrating diagnosis of the human condition and show decisively that the true remedy for our ills is in Jesus Christ--and Him alone.</p><p>Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981) was born in Wales. He was a dairyman&#39;s assistant, a political enthusiast, debater, and chief clinical assistant to Sir Thomas Harder, the King&#39;s Physician. But at the age of 27 he gave up a most promising medical career to become a preacher. He had a far-reaching influence through his ministry at Westminster Chapel in London, England from 1938-68. His published works have had an unprecedented circulation, selling in millions of copies.&#34;The world today is vastly different from the one in which our author lived. Yet despite all the advances of science and technology it would be hard to argue that it is a better place. While men and women look for answers that might be anticipated in the future, the Bible tells us that the answer is found in something accomplished in the past. Christ died for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God. It is this unchanging truth that we are to believe and proclaim in these changing times.&#34; -- Alistair Begg</p><h2>The Willie Lynch Letter And The Making of A Slave</h2><p>The Willie Lynch Letter and the Making of a Slave is a study of slave making. It discribes the rationale and the results of Anglo Saxon&#39;s ideas and methods of insuring the master/slave relationship. The infamous Willie Lynch letter gives both African and Caucasian students and teachers some insight, concerning the brutal and inhumane psychology behind the African slave trade. The materialistic viewpoint of Southern plantation owners that slaver was a business and the victims of chattel slavery were merely pawns in an economic game of debauchery, cross-breeding, inter-racial rape and mental conditioning of a negroid race, they considered sub-human. Equally important is the international nature of the European economic, political and cultural climate that influenced the slave trade. Within the time scale of African History, it was a relatively short period, a mere one and a half centuries from the most intensive phase of the Atlantic slave trade to the advent of European administration and dominance. Long before that the Slave Coast had been chartered by the Portuguese and the people off the area west of Benin, between the volta River and Lagos, European traders traced a cultural history which linked them with the earliest Yoruba settlements to the north and eastern borders of Africa.</p><p></p><h2>Instant Art History: From Cave Art to Pop Art</h2><p>From the prehistoric cave paintings to Andy Warhol's soup cans, this lively chronicle surveys the rich history of artistic expression.

A sandhog, he burrows beneath the East River, digging the tunnel that will carry trains from Brooklyn to Manhattan. In the bowels of the riverbed, the sandhogs--black, white, Irish, Italian--dig together, the darkness erasing all differences. Above ground, though, the men keep their distance until a spectacular accident welds a bond between Walker and his fellow sandhogs that will both bless and curse three generations.</p></p><p><i>This Side of Brightness</i> weaves historical fact with fictional truth, creating a remarkable tale of death, racism, homelessness--and yes, love--spanning four generations. Two characters dominate Colum McCann's narrative: Treefrog, a homeless man with a dark and shameful secret, and Nathan Walker, a black man who came north in the early years of the century to work as a "sandhog," digging the subway tunnels beneath Manhattan. Tunneling is perhaps the most dangerous occupation a man could have; in the close, dark, and dangerous pits far beneath the city streets, differences such as color or ethnic background cease to matter, and Walker soon becomes friends with his crewmates: two Irishmen and an Italian. Then an explosion in one of the tunnels literally blows Walker and three other men up through the earth and into the East River. Walker survives, but his best friend Con O'Leary is never found. Leary leaves behind a wife and young daughter whom Walker marries many years later. <p> Walker's tale is told in alternating chapters with Treefrog's, who, before his slide into homelessness, chose a hazardous profession--this one high up in the bright sunlight--as a construction worker building skyscrapers. But madness has brought Treefrog out of the light and back to the tunnels that Walker helped dig as he scrapes out a meager existence among the drug addicts, alcoholics, prostitutes, and petty criminals that make up the homeless community. But the grimness of McCann's tale is leavened by the beauty of his prose and the intimations all through the book that, even on this side of darkness, redemption is possible.</p><b>Colum McCann</b> is the author of books including <i>This Side of Brightness</i>, <i>Zoli</i>, <i>Songdogs</i> and <i>Let the Great World Spin</i>.

By the following Passover, however, only one is still alive: Benjamin Israelien; a kindly, innocent, ignorant man-child. As he finds himself transformed into an international superstar, Jewishness becomes all the rage: matzo-ball soup is in every bowl, sidelocks are hip; and the only truly Jewish Jew left is increasingly stigmatized for not being religious. Since his very existence exposes the illegitimacy of the newly converted, Israelien becomes the object of a worldwide hunt...</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the not-too-distant future of our own, &#x201c;real&#x201d; world, another last Jew&#x2015;the last living Holocaust survivor&#x2015;sits alone in a snowbound Manhattan, providing a final melancholy witness to his experiences in the form of the punch lines to half-remembered jokes.</p></p><p>"In this ambitious novel, Benjamin Israelien&#x2015;born full grown, bearded, and wearing glasses&#x2015;is the last living Jew, a national celebrity and Messiah-like great hope for an America terrified of losing God&#x2019;s grace. In more than eight hundred pages of dense, often self-amused prose, he tours in a big revival show, visits Holocaust sites (&#x201c;Whateverwitz&#x201d; in &#x201c;Polandland&#x201d;), and even makes a brief sojourn in space with a tentacled alien named Doktor Froid. &#x201c;Witz,&#x201d; as Cohen explains, means &#x201c;joke,&#x201d; and the novel overflows with puns, allusions, and Borscht Belt zingers, in an incantatory modernist style." (<i>New Yorker</i>)Joshua Cohen, born in 1980 in Somers Point, N.J., is one of the most ambitious young novelists in English. <i>Witz</i> is his fourth novel; he&#x2019;s also written four collections of stories, a book-length essay called <i>Attention!</i> (2013), and extensive criticism for <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, <i>The Believer</i>, <i>The London Review of Books</i>, and <i>The Jewish Daily Forward</i>.

The memoir begins with a childhood mystical experience and continues with the author&#39;s responses to the Christ she began to recognize in her brothers and sisters everywhere.</p><p>An author and retreat leader, Gateley has led a fascinating life&#x2014;an exceptional blend of contemplation and action that has taken her to places as divergent as the Sahara desert and the streets of Chicago, where she created a refuge for prostitutes. In this memoir, she recounts her journey in poetry and prose, beginning with a spiritual experience at age five, when she awoke in the night to see a beautiful shining woman she later concluded was the Virgin Mary. A devout Catholic child, Gateley decided as a teen to give her life to God. After teaching in Africa, she returned to her native England to found the Volunteer Missionary Movement, an organization of lay missionaries. By 1993, Gateley had become a popular speaker, but an incident in which she was photographed holding a chalice at an altar&#x2014;which, she explains, she did by invitation and not as a priestly act&#x2014;led to her being barred from some Catholic dioceses. Today, she writes, she increasingly faces exclusion from doing what she most feels called to do. Despite this, her writing is remarkably absent of bitterness, and she manages to end on a hopeful note. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He loves them so much, in fact, that he decided to invent his own&#x2014;to create a brand new verbal concept and successfully implant it into the English language, and the<i> Oxford English Dictionary</i>. But breaking into the dictionary was going to take more than just a gentle word in the ear of the <i>OED</i>'s editor, as Alex soon discovered. Evidence was required&#x2014;Alex needed proof that his word was in print and used by more people than just him and his mom. He needed, to use the dictionary's word, a "corpus" of examples, so a corpus he resolved to create. And he gave himself&nbsp;1,000 days in which to do it. This is the story of what happened next. Did Alex get a word in the<i> OED</i>? What is a pratdigger? Are you already using one of Alex's words without realizing it? You won't regret spending your hard-earned honk on this hugely entertaining book full of wordy trivia and funny tales of verbal invention.</p><p>Alex Horne is a stand-up comedian, nominated in 2003&nbsp;for the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He is the author of <i>Birdwatchingwatching</i>, based on his show <i>Birdwatching</i>, which appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe. His follow-up show, <i>Wordwatchin</i>g, also appeared at the festival.The author, a comedian by trade, has loved words and wordplay pretty much as long as he can remember. Approaching his tkday, the word he made up to denote one's 10,000th day on Earth, he realized he really wanted to do something important. What better way to do that than to invent a new word or two? For the rest of human history, people would be saying things that he created. Of course, getting a new word into the lexicon isn't as easy as making one up and sending it to a dictionary editor&#x2014;for example, you have to demonstrate that your made-up word is actually being used, that it has an accepted meaning. The book follows Horne's efforts to get his new words into general circulation, a challenge that involves slipping his lexographic creations into public forums (for instance, using one on a popular TV show) and generally making a cheerful nuisance of himself. A very enjoyable book that should spark the interest of word lovers and do-it-yourselfers, not to mention fans of offbeat memoirs by A. J. Jacobs, Danny Wallace, and Dave Gorman. --David Pitt</p><h2>Celia, a Slave (Gender and Slavery)</h2><p><p>Illuminating the moral dilemmas that lie at the heart of a slaveholding society, this book tells the story of a young slave who was sexually exploited by her master and ultimately executed for his murder.</p><p>Celia was only fourteen years old when she was acquired by John Newsom, an aging widower and one of the most prosperous and respected citizens of Callaway County, Missouri. The pattern of sexual abuse that would mark their entire relationship began almost immediately. After purchasing Celia in a neighboring county, Newsom raped her on the journey back to his farm. He then established her in a small cabin near his house and visited her regularly (most likely with the knowledge of the son and two daughters who lived with him). Over the next five years, Celia bore Newsom two children; meanwhile, she became involved with a slave named George and resolved at his insistence to end the relationship with her master. When Newsom refused, Celia one night struck him fatally with a club and disposed of his body in her fireplace.</p><p>Her act quickly discovered, Celia was brought to trial. She received a surprisingly vigorous defense from her court-appointed attorneys, who built their case on a state law allowing women the use of deadly force to defend their honor. Nevertheless, the court upheld the tenets of a white social order that wielded almost total control over the lives of slaves. Celia was found guilty and hanged.</p><p>Melton A. McLaurin uses Celia's story to reveal the tensions that strained the fabric of antebellum southern society. Celia's case demonstrates how one master's abuse of power over a single slave forced whites to make moral decisions about the nature of slavery. McLaurin focuses sharply on the role of gender, exploring the degree to which female slaves were sexually exploited, the conditions that often prevented white women from stopping such abuse, and the inability of male slaves to defend slave women. Setting the case in the context of the 1850s slavery debates, he also probes the manner in which the legal system was used to justify slavery. By granting slaves certain statutory rights (which were usually rendered meaningless by the customary prerogatives of masters), southerners could argue that they observed moral restraint in the operations of their peculiar institution.</p><p>An important addition to our understanding of the pre-Civil War era, <i>Celia, A Slave</i> is also an intensely compelling narrative of one woman pushed beyond the limits of her endurance by a system that denied her humanity at the most basic level.</p></p><p><p>In 1850, fourteen-year-old Celia became the property of Robert Newsom, a prosperous and respected Missouri farmer. For the next five years, she was cruelly and repeatedly molested by her abusive master--and bore him two children in the process. But in 1855, driven to the limits of her endurance, Celia fought back. And at the tender age of eighteen, the desperate and frightened young black woman found herself on trial for Newsom's murder--the defendant in a landmark courtroom battle that threatened to undermine the very foundations of the South's most cherished institution. Based on court records, correspondences and newspaper accounts past and present, <em>Celia, A Slave</em> is a powerful masterwork of passion and scholarship--a stunning literary achievement that brilliantly illuminates one of the most extraordinary events in the long, dark history of slavery in America.</p>MELTON A.

John Bell Hood surveyed the army waiting to attack the Federals at Franklin, Tennessee. He gave the signal almost at dusk, and the Confederates rushed forward to utter devastation. This book describes the events and causes of the five-hour battle in gripping detail, particularly focusing on the reasons for such slaughter at a time when the outcome of the war had already been decided.<br><br>The genesis of the senseless tragedy, according to McDonough and Connelly, lay in the appointment of Hood to command the Army of Tennessee. It was his decision to throw a total force of some 20,000 men into an ill-advised frontal assault against the Union troops. The Confederates made their approach, without substantial artillery support, on a level of some two miles. Why did Hood select such a catastrophic strategy? The authors analyze his reasoning in full.

Could she really give him the answers he is looking for?</p><p>The quirky premise of Carolyn Parkhurst's debut novel, <i>The Dogs of Babel</i>, is original enough: after his wife Lexy dies after falling from a tree, linguistics professor Paul Iverson becomes obsessed with teaching their dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Lorelei (the sole witness to the tragedy), to speak so he can find out the truth about Lexy's death--was it accidental or did Lexy commit suicide? <p> In short, accelerating chapters Parkhurst alternates between Paul's strange and passionate efforts to get Lorelei to communicate and his heartfelt memories of his whirlwind relationship with Lexy. The first 100 pages or so bring to mind another noteworthy debut, Alice Sebold's brilliant exploration of grief, <i>The Lovely Bones</i>. Unfortunately, the second half of <i>The Dogs of Babel</i> takes too many odd twists and turns--everything from a Ms. Cleo-like TV psychic to an underground sect of abusive canine linguists--to ever allow the reader to feel any real sympathy for the main characters. Parkhurst's Paul Iverson can certainly be appealing at times, and his heartbreak is often quite palpable ("...for every dark moment we shared between us, there was a moment of such brightness I almost could not bear to look at it head-on."). But his mask-maker wife Lexy--Paul's driving inspiration--is a character whose spur-of-the-moment outbursts, spontaneous fits of anger, and supposedly charming sense of whimsy (on their first date, they drive from Virginia to Disney World, eating only appetizers and side dishes along the way), become so annoying and grating that it's hard to believe anyone could ever put up with her, let alone teach their dog to speak for her. </p><p> Despite its cloying tone, <i>The Dogs of Babel</i> marks a notable debut. Parkhurst possesses a wealth of inspired ideas, and no doubt many readers will respond to the book, but one hopes that the author's future efforts will be packed with richer character development and less schmaltz. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>Carolyn Parkhurst holds an MFA in creative writing from American University.

The Charles Ives that emerges from Swafford's story is a precocious, well-trained musician, a brilliant if mercurial thinker about art and life, and an experimenter in the spirit of Edison and the Wright brothers.</p><p>This is a scholarly assessment of the American composer Charles Ives, whose life and work have remained enigmatic since his death in 1954. A successful insurance executive in Hartford, Connecticut, Ives used a considerable part of his tidy income to promote serious modern music, and despite his day job maintained a prolific output of scores himself. He was a robustly opinionated and confident individual who eschewed easy listening; his atonal works were considered almost un-American. Yet he also sought recognition that just eluded him in his lifetime. Ives is increasingly known around the world. Jan Swafford, himself a composer, should help win even more interest with this sympathetic biography.A decent, thoughtful, and idealistic biography of American music's radical idealist. Judged by the first criterion of musical biography--does it make us want to listen to the music?--this portrait of ``Charlie'' Ives must be counted a success. Yankee bandmaster's son, Yalie, rebel modernist, insurance executive, and Romantic visionary who spent the last quarter-century of his life retouching a ``Universe'' symphony that was never completed to his satisfaction: The outline of the story is familiar to readers with a general interest in 20th-century American music. Swafford's personal slant is frankly to admit his own sympathy with the social progressivism that underlay Ives's approach to both his art and his go-getting business career. Unlike the psychobiographers who have been attracted to Ives (see Stuart Feder's Charles Ives, ``My Father's Song''), Swafford has no interest in probing Ives's weaknesses. He is receptive to, rather than critical of, the expansive, can-do, ``universalist individualism''--a legacy from the 19th-century Transcendentalists whom Ives ``portrayed'' in the Concord Sonata- -which shaped Ives's beliefs about family, marriage, career, and artistic output. Since the author owns to this empathetic approach to his subject, the reader is readier to pardon the occasional gushing quality of Swafford's prose and some questionable, frankly subjective music judgements (e.g., The Unanswered Question is not a work of Ives's musical maturity). To his credit, Swafford has done a good job of setting out the gratifying story of how Ives's music was championed and actively promoted by other composers and musical leaders, including Aaron Copland, Henry Cowell, Leonard Bernstein, and Leopold Stokowski. A conscientious, intellectually honest sifting of the plentiful evidence, though undoubtedly not the last word on its subject. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her stories begin in unexpected places, and take surprising turns toward their eventual end. She doesn&#x2019;t describe life; she exposes it. She doesn&#x2019;t write scenes, she evokes them with a finely observed gesture, casually reinterpreted to provide maximum, often devastating, insight: <br>He had straddled the baby as it crept across the ground as though little Mal were a gulch he had no intention of falling into. <br>The baby in this startling image is Mal Vester, the unlucky and unloved protagonist of &#x201c;Dimmer.&#x201d; He is a survivor, but there is no romantic luster to his suffering. Mal is rough, untamed, stricken, desperate, and alone. His father, who never wanted him, dies in the first sentence; his mother, the only person who loved him without restraint, dies in the second. Her death haunts this beatiful, moving story, right up until the very last line; but what keeps us reading to the end is the prose, which constantly unpacks and explains Mal&#x2019;s unlikely world with inventive and striking images. Williams has done something special: she makes Mal&#x2019;s drifting, his lack of agency, narratively compelling. Life happens to Mal; it is inflicted upon him, a series of misfortunes that culminate in his exile. (A lonelier airport has never appeared in short fiction.) Mal never speaks, but somehow, I didn&#x2019;t realize it until the third time I&#x2019;d read &#x201c;Dimmer.&#x201d; I knew him so well, felt his tentative joy and fear so intimately, it was as if he&#x2019;d been whispering in my ear all along. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by The Paris Review <br></p><h2>God Cares: The Message of Daniel for You and Your Family</h2><p>God Cares: The Message of Daniel for You and Your Family [Feb 01, 1981] Maxwe...</p><p>Maxwell is chairman of the department of church history and professor of church history at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan.

Never before has the American involvement in Normandy been examined so thoroughly or exclusively as in <i>The Americans at Normandy.</i> For D-Day was only one part of the battle, and victory came from weeks of sustained effort and sacrifices made by Allied soldiers.</p><p>Presented here is the American experience during that summer of 1944, from the aftermath of D-Day to the slaughter of the Falaise Gap, from the courageous, famed figures of Bradley, Patton, and "Lightning" Joe Collins to the lesser-known privates who toiled in torturous conditions for their country.</p><p>Engrossing, lightning-quick, and filled with real human sorrow and elation, <i>The Americans at Normandy</i> honors those Americans who lost their lives in foreign fields and those who survived. Here is their story, finally told with the depth, pathos, and historical perspective it deserves.</p></p><p><p><b>John C. McManus</b> is a professor of military history at the University of Missouri. He has traveled extensively in researching his books about the American experience in World War II.</p>Long on engrossing combat vignettes but short on historical perspective, this fine-grained narrative covers some 80 days of the American campaign in France, from the bloody stalemate in the hedgerows to the decisive breakout and defeat of the German army in Normandy. In line with the Stephen Ambrose school of populist historiography that sees the campaign as the Greatest Generation&#x2019;s finest hour, military historian McManus (The Americans at D-Day, etc.) challenges historians who have characterized the U.S. Army&#x2019;s performance as sluggish, tactically inept and dependent on a colossal superiority in numbers and firepower over its German opponents. He does so by focusing on the battlefield exploits of small infantry units and individual GIs, whom he feels displayed plenty of drive and tactical ingenuity. These well-paced and often moving stories, based on veterans&#x2019; first-hand reminiscences, are full of blood and guts, squalor and heroism, pathos and despair, and they add up to an indelible portrait of the horror of war. But McManus&#x2019;s conclusion that the Americans were "better soldiers" than the Germans is both unfair and untenable. The details of his account make clear that American infantry tactics did indeed rely on the crushing assistance of tanks, artillery and airpower. Meanwhile, he avoids meticulous comparisons of front-line strengths that would reveal how hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned the Wehrmacht was, while his exclusive interest in the American side neglects the tactical achievements German soldiers pulled off with incomparably skimpier resources. The many war stories McManus offers make for a gripping read, but they add up to a seriously biased picture of the Allied victory.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She shares her knowledge in her popular workshops and now in this book. Cohen, who has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for eighteen years, was hobbling painfully to her local Zen center one day, when she made a discovery that changed her life: if she focused on the foot that was in the air rather than the one that was hitting the pavement, her stamina increased enormously. It was the beginning of a completely different approach to the crippling pain that had beset her for so long. As she demonstrates here, this approach can be expanded to all types of pain: physical, psychological, and spiritual. <br><br>Cohen&#x2014;a certified massage and movement therapist and Zen teacher&#x2014;proposes a radically liberating alternative to the usual desperate search for pain relief: paradoxically, she says, release from suffering lies in paying closer attention to it. When we keep pain at bay, we keep pleasure at bay, too. The two are interdependent, and our ability to experience each is totally dependent on our understanding of the other. <br><br>"Enrich your life exponentially," Cohen advises. If your pain is one of the ten things you are aware of, then it constitutes a tenth of your total awareness. Expand your awareness to a hundred things, however, and your pain is only a hundredth of your awareness. With stories, strategies, exercises, and an awareness born of long Zen practice, Cohen shows us how to tap into that enrichment&#x2014;and how we can lead a satisfying and even joyful life in the very midst of pain. <br><br>This book was published in hardcover under the title <i>Finding a Joyful Life in the Heart of Pain. </i></p><p>For the past 20 years author Darlene Cohen has had rheumatoid arthritis, a painful and crippling condition. "I became isolated from everyone I knew by my pain and fear and ultimately even by the consuming effort I had to make to do any little thing--like get up from a chair, fix a cup of tea," she writes. How do we live through catastrophic situations such as Cohen's without being destroyed? For starters, don't go numb, suggests Cohen, a Zen teacher who offers pain seminars in medical facilities and meditation centers along the West Coast. "If we don't acknowledge our pain, we usually don't feel our pleasure either," Cohen explains. "Life takes on a zombie-like tenor." In fact, many of our most self-destructive habits come from an avoidance of physical or emotional pain, claims Cohen, such as substance abuse, becoming overly scheduled or overly busy, avoiding intimacy to avoid hurt. Through storytelling, attitude adjustments, meditation exercises, and straight-from-the-heart advice, Cohen guides readers into a more alive and joyful life, even in the midst of pain. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Darlene Cohen is a Zen teacher who counsels chronic pain clients and gives arthritis workshops, classes, lectures, and pain seminars in private practice and at medical facilities and meditation centers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Spokane, Washington, and Evanston, Illinois.

That&#x2019;s what made her so good at her job investigating insurance fraud.<br><br>This morning she&#x2019;d been called to a warehouse fire in West Sacramento, at the Port of Sacramento near the docks where the Deep Water Ship Channel connected the Sacramento River to the San Francisco Bay. The port predominantly handled agricultural products, but container goods from China and beyond were not uncommon. They didn&#x2019;t have customs or any serious inspections, which were taken care of at the port of entry. As far as docks went, they were relatively clean and quiet, even at seven in the morning. Most of the activity was at the far end where a ship was being loaded with produce Claire couldn&#x2019;t identify from this distance.<br><br>She breathed deeply, the lingering scent of burned wood, scorched metal, and ash making her grimace. Best to get this out of the way now, before the temperature rose. It was only the second week of May, yet summer had arrived. While the rest of the country enjoyed spring, yesterday Sacramento had peaked at ninety-five. Today would be even hotter.<br><br>Claire was supposed to meet the arson investigator here at eight, but she liked hitting the scene early to do her own walk-through. She&#x2019;d already done everything she could from the office; the two final pieces for the report were the walk-through and interviewing the claimant.<br><br>Five-shot Starbucks latte in hand&#x2014;as much to combat the mild hangover from her late night as to wake her up&#x2014;Claire grabbed her backpack from the backseat of her Jeep, absently brushing dog hair off her jeans. She had to remember to cover the seats with towels when she took Chewy and Yoda on car rides.<br><br>Crime scene tape cut across the front of the warehouse&#x2014;but since it was a mere shell and incapable of being locked up, she slid under the tape. Arson. She smelled it.<br><br>Warehouses sometimes burned down by accident. A careless employee left a cigarette butt burning, lightning struck, homeless people tried to get warm in the frigid Sacramento winters.<br><br>But accidents were rare.<br><br>The building owner hadn&#x2019;t even been smart about it, Claire thought as she walked around taking pictures and notes. There was no evidence of burned goods. They could have been stolen before the arson, but Claire suspected the merchandise had never arrived or had been sold before the arson. She&#x2019;d already pulled the financials of Ben Holman and Holman Medical Supply Company, Inc. Operating on the wrong side of a razor-thin profit margin, Ben Holman was three months late on his personal home mortgage and his creditors all had 90- to 120-day lates on him.<br><br>Convenient timing for an insurance claim that would give him half a mil for supplies and damage.<br><br>Holman would likely claim faulty wiring . . . possible, of course. These dockside warehouses were old and rarely did the owners upgrade the interiors. They were used for the temporary storage of goods that came down the Sacramento River shipping lane. Product came, product left&#x2014;cogs in the wheels of the economy. But in this instance? No way. It was arson, and Claire just needed to wait for the fire investigator to show up and confirm it.<br><br>Holman Medical Supply Company, Inc., would soon be one less cog to muck it up for legitimate business people.<br><br>Claire deeply breathed in the fresh air as soon as she cleared the building, then leaned against a cement wall to write up questions for warehouse-owner Holman.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know Claire had security tape from the warehouse three down that showed him driving up the day before the fire started. He didn&#x2019;t know she had a copy of the manifest filed with customs in San Francisco. And he would certainly deny knowing where the missing goods were, though she had a contact who said an unusually large supply of syringes had shown up on the streets yesterday.<br><br>Ben Holman was just one more pathetic human being who proved that no one could be trusted.<br><br>Claire drained the rest of her lukewarm latte, stuffed her notebook and camera back into her pack, and stretched, hoping the investigator wouldn&#x2019;t be late. She wanted to write up the report and meet her veterinarian at her house at noon. Dr. Jim made house calls, at least for her. She had started toward her Jeep when she heard a deep male voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Claire.&#x201d;<br><br>At the familiar voice, she dropped her cup and pack, reaching for the gun she carried in a belt holster in the small of her back, and began to turn when someone from behind grabbed her arm, bending it up and back. She aimed a perfect kick to her attacker&#x2019;s balls, but he anticipated the move and sidestepped it, spinning her around and pushing her against the cement wall she&#x2019;d been leaning on, knocking the wind out of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Claire, stop. I need five minutes. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>Daddy.<br><br>Raw anger and deep sadness always accompanied any thoughts of her father. But here&#x2014;now, in person&#x2014;the anger and sadness were magnified. She heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing, except the familiar stranger in front of her. Heard him breathing, felt his heart beating as her arms were trapped between her chest and his, saw the plea in his vivid blue eyes, eyes like her own.<br><br>Once, she had loved him. Trusted him. Worshipped him. She remembered the past with such clarity that it took her breath away.<br><br>He looked so much older now. Of course he did. She&#x2019;d never visited him in prison. She hadn&#x2019;t seen him in fifteen years, since the trial, since she&#x2019;d testified for the prosecution against her own father.<br><br>It had been nearly four months since Tom O&#x2019;Brien had escaped from prison during the San Quentin Earthquake. Four months and no word except that her father had become some sort of a dark hero, helping authorities capture the other escapees, while slipping away undetected. She&#x2019;d talked repeatedly with local and federal cops, endured weeks of stakeouts outside her home, sacrificing her privacy. For a while, she even thought he was dead. And when she finally believed he had disappeared for good, he showed up here. Now. Like a ghost.<br><br>Love and hatred for this man overwhelmed Claire.<br><br>Tears welled up in her eyes. To force them back she pictured the dead, bloody body of her mother. Fifteen years might have seemed like a lifetime, but the sight and smell of blood was as fresh in her senses as if Claire had walked in on the murder this morning.<br><br>Daddy.<br><br>She pushed against him, but he had her pinned tightly to the wall. Her gun dug into her back, and the pepper spray on her keychain was in her pocket, out of reach.<br><br>&#x201c;Claire, I don&#x2019;t have a lot of time. The Feds are watching you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Are,&#x201d; he contradicted. &#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t believe me, that you never believed me, but I didn&#x2019;t kill your mother. And I have proof.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t believe you then, and I don&#x2019;t believe you now.&#x201d;<br><br>His face hardened, but his eyes watered. Looking at her father was like looking at an older, masculine version of herself.<br><br>They&#x2019;d done so much together before that awful, life-ending day. Biking. Skiing. Camping. She desperately wanted to believe him because they&#x2019;d been &#x201c;two peas in a pod,&#x201d; as her mother used to say.<br><br>The mother he had killed.<br><br>Claire knew the truth. It was as much her fault as his, but he was the one who&#x2019;d pulled the trigger and coldly killed two people.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Dad,&#x201d; she said, surprising herself as her throat swallowed the tremble in her voice. &#x201c;I should never have told you about Mom&#x2019;s affair. It was childish of me. I just didn&#x2019;t know then that everyone lies, cheats, and steals for personal gain.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked as if she&#x2019;d hit him. &#x201c;None of that was your fault, Claire. Your mother had had affairs before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you said at the trial, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was convenient for you. And would it really matter? Even if she&#x2019;d screwed around with a dozen men it wouldn&#x2019;t change the fact that Mom and her current lover were screwing in your bed when you walked in and shot them.&#x201d;<br><br>She was on a roll. She stared at him, remembered that he had been convicted in a court of law by twelve jurors. He&#x2019;d been convicted of murder, and few innocent people went to prison.<br><br>&#x201c;You would have said anything to get out of prison. The D.A. offered you a plea. You didn&#x2019;t have to get the death penalty! You could have pled guilty. Maybe if you&#x2019;d just admitted the truth I could have lived with it, I could have forgiven you, but you just lied and lied and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t lying,&#x201d; he insisted, his jaw tight. &#x201c;Everything I told you then was the truth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The evidence showed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The evidence was circumstantial. Someone framed me. I have proof.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What proof? If you had proof, why didn&#x2019;t you bring it up during one of your half-dozen appeals? Have your attorney petition the court? There is no proof that you&#x2019;re innocent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And there was no proof that I was guilty!&#x201d; he shouted in her ear, his voice shaking. &#x201c;It was all circumstantial, Claire. A setup. A frame&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, so why don&#x2019;t you go find the real killer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dammit!&#x201d; He took a deep breath. &#x201c;I need to find Oliver Maddox. I know he spoke to you in January before&#x201d;&#x2014;he paused&#x2014;&#x201c;the earthquake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before you escaped from prison? Let&#x2019;s call a spade a spade, Daddy, okay? No bullshit. You&#x2019;re an escaped killer and they&#x2019;ll shoot first, and frankly, no one gives a shit about your answers.&#x201d;<br><br>Claire&#x2019;s insides were twisted and burning. She&#x2019;d never talked to her father like that, had never raised her voice or sworn at him.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t think of him as your father. He&#x2019;s an escaped prisoner. A convict. A murderer.<br><br>His hardened, but pain lit his eyes. &#x201c;Oliver Maddox has information I need to prove my innocence. He works with the Western Innocence Project. I tried calling him, but his phone isn&#x2019;t working. I can&#x2019;t very well go looking for him. I think someone scared him into hiding. I need your help to find him. I don&#x2019;t have anyone else to turn to, Claire.&#x201d;<br><br>She blinked back tears. More lies from her father. &#x201c;After I talked to Maddox, I did a little research. I&#x2019;m good at that. He&#x2019;s just a law student, not even an attorney. Doesn&#x2019;t even work for the Western Innocence Project&#x2014;he was an intern last summer. They were never going to take up your case.&#x201d;<br><br>Her father shook his head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true. Oliver planned on meeting me the week before the earthquake. He said he had information about Lydia&#x2019;s lover, Chase Taverton. Evidence that he was the primary target. Taverton was a prosecutor. If he was the target, that opens an entire pool of suspects, and the detectives barely looked at that possibility.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re grasping at straws&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oliver has even more information,&#x201d; he continued quickly, &#x201c;but he never showed for our meeting, and I couldn&#x2019;t reach him. The next day, I was transferred into the general prison population.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t put cops in with the general population.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something happened. Someone got to him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t spoken to Oliver Maddox since I kicked him out of my house months ago when I found out he&#x2019;d lied to me. He lied to me, and he lied to you. He was just a kid jerking your chain, he didn&#x2019;t have the Project behind him, and he probably didn&#x2019;t know anything that would help you unless he made it up. You were a cop once. You should know how many killers claim they&#x2019;re innocent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So who did it? In the twenty minutes between when I left the house and called you and you walked in, who broke into our house and killed them? And why? You know, Dad, usually the most obvious answer is the correct one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Claire, but you have to believe me. The only reason I care about proving my innocence is to prove it to you. I don&#x2019;t want you looking at me the way you are right now. I want my little girl back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a little girl.&#x201d; She found it hard to catch her breath. She couldn&#x2019;t think, she just wanted him to disappear.<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; His voice quivered. &#x201c;Please, Claire, I&#x2019;m risking everything coming to you. I need your help. I can&#x2019;t do this on my own. I went to the campus, his house, couldn&#x2019;t find him. I couldn&#x2019;t ask more questions without drawing attention. I need to find out where he went and exactly what he knew, get him to tell the truth no matter who threatened him. Working for Rogan-Caruso Protective Services, you have access to far more information and resources than I do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would I help you? I could lose everything I&#x2019;ve built since you went to prison,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My career, my PI license, my home. I don&#x2019;t want to go to jail.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Claire. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>The quiet plea twisted her heart. &#x201c;Go away. Leave me alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anyone else,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>She spoke equally quietly. &#x201c;Well, then, you don&#x2019;t have anyone, Dad.&#x201d;<br><br>A truck turned onto the road heading for the warehouse.<br><br>&#x201c;Think about this, Claire. Think about me. I&#x2019;m not a killer. You know that in your heart.&#x201d;<br><br>To prevent her from pursuing him, he pushed her down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he called as he ran in the opposite direction of the approaching truck.<br><br>Claire slowly pulled herself up. She might have been able to chase after and catch her father, but what would she do? Shoot him in the back?<br><br>Instead she put her hands on her knees and fought to regain some semblance of control over her emotions. To try and forget the pain in her father&#x2019;s eyes. To try and forget the pain twisting in her heart.<br><br>The truck belonged to the arson investigator, Pete Jackson.

Horst, a leading fashion photographer of his time, developed an intense interest in seeing the world&#x2019;s great homes and meeting their owners; beginning in the early 1960s, he journeyed in an elite world that would soon be lost. With accompanying lyrical essays about homes and their occupants by the famed writer Valentine Lawford (Horst&#x2019;s partner in work and life), the book is a virtual who&#x2019;s who of society, politics, and the arts in the mid-20th century. <i>Around That Time</i> showcases much of the material featured in the original book, plus never-before-seen photographs from those homes as well as images from additional homes Horst shot well into the 1980s. This book introduces this work to a new generation of design, decorating, and visual art professionals, academics, and enthusiasts.</p><p><b>Horst P.

How are we related to it, and what is our place in it? The Book of the Cosmos assembles for the first time in one volume the great minds of the Western world who have considered these questions from biblical times to the present. It is a book of many authors-Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Galileo are here, of course, in all their genius, but so are Edgar Allan Poe, Annie Jump Cannon (a &#34;human computer&#34; and lyrical classifier of stars), and Sir Martin Rees, who proposes an &#34;ensemble of universes&#34; of which ours happens to be among the most interesting.In these pages the universe is made and unmade in a variety of configurations; it spins along on superstrings, teems with intelligent life, and could end without warning. The Book of the Cosmos provides a thrilling read to set the heart racing and the mind soaring.</p><p>So many books published these days seem to deliberately ignore the forest for the trees, or the leaves, or the chloroplasts, or the chemistry of biopigments. Readers interested in big questions usually have to make do with the obligatory summing-up at the end, in which the author tries to justify his or her narrow interest through heroic feats of recontextualization. <i>The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking</i>, on the other hand, is 600 pages of well-expressed deep thought on the biggest picture of them all. In roughly chronological order, editor Dennis Danielson presents 85 sets of excerpts from big thinkers from biblical times to the present, introducing each to the modern reader with insightful running commentary that is consistently helpful without being obtrusive.<p> The ancient Greeks hit the ground running, leaving us a rich conceptual legacy, which we are still exploring and exploiting even as our own work becomes more and more machine-mediated. Danielson gives us a wide base of ancient thought to give a sense of our heritage. He includes both obvious choices, such as Plato, and lesser-known writers, such as Parmenides. The often neglected Middle Ages brought us Ptolemy, Moses Maimonides, and others who set the stage for the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and the writings from these times betray an unexpected continuity of thought between the ancient and modern eras. Of course, the late-20th-century selections of such writers as Freeman Dyson and Steven Weinberg, which close the book, shouldn't imply an end to cosmological thinking. If anything, the last chapters of <i>The Book of the Cosmos</i> provoke a hunger for more. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Dennis Danielson</b> is Professor of English at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he teaches honors and graduate courses in the literature of cosmology.</p><h2>Fantastic!

Plants that Never Ever Bloom: A Book About Fungi, Ferns, and Other Plants Without Flowers</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Grade 2-5-Heller's latest book on the parts of speech shows not only exuberance toward her subject, but also connectivity to her earlier titles. What else would interjections and conjunctions do? Youngsters will delight in the rhyming text, which artistically weaves information through vibrant illustrations. While similar in style to the other books, each page of this effort is surprisingly fresh and new (Zebras have brightly colored stripes). The author offers a historical perspective to interjections, from the contemporary "Cool!" to the archaic "Alack!" There is also a full explanation of the types of conjunctions. This title is a must-have for school media centers as it provides sheer enjoyment and stimulating instruction for both students and teachers. Other libraries serving young readers should consider it as well. Wow!

Bean&#39;s Century of Outfitting America</h2><p>L.L. Bean&#x2019;s story is also America&#x2019;s story. The ideas and events that drove the company&#x2019;s development are all related to what was happening in the wider world. From the rugged, individualistic legacy of Teddy Roosevelt in the 1910s to soldiers&#x2019; experiences in both World Wars, from the &#x201c;back to the land&#x201d; movement in the 1960s and 1970s that brought millions of people to the wilderness for the first time to the Preppy Handbook craze of the 1980s when the styles of New England suddenly enthralled the nation, Guaranteed to Last tells a complete and fascinating story that will engage every reader. <br><br>At the heart of the book is a fresh telling of the fascinating L.L. Bean story&#x2015;the tale of how an unknown hunter, working with $400 in borrowed capital, invented a new kind of shoe and, marching to the beat of his own drum, remade the outdoor industry. And it&#x2019;s a story about how the company helped America learn to love the outdoors. A brisk narrative based on fresh interviews and research by Jim Gorman, a leading travel and adventure journalist, traces the most important incidents in the company&#x2019;s history, as well as the defining products and the most memorable people. <br><br>The book will feature scores of photographs, illustrations, and pieces of ephemera, including fascinating images of L.L. Bean hunting in Maine in the 1910s; the earliest mailers and catalogs that defined the look and voice of the company; personal correspondence to L.L. Bean from every era; snapshots of ordinary Americans outfitted in their L.L. Bean gear; and much more. It is both a celebration of 100 years of L.L. Bean, and a look at the essential qualities of the brand that will guide its next century.<br><br></p><p>Jim Gorman is an award-winning book and magazine author.

Bean thrive as scores of other retailers withered? Durable goods, a great reputation, and savvy retailing had a lot to do with it. But America was also changing in ways that played to L.L. Bean&#x2019;s strengths. Paid vacation, a foreign concept during the Industrial Era, was becoming the norm (for those lucky enough to be working). By the end of the Thirties, half of American workers would earn paid time off, the luckiest enjoying two weeks or more. Whereas a Sunday afternoon spent picnicking in a local park was the best the average person could muster at the turn of the twentieth century, Americans in the late-1930s had sufficient time off to get out of town. And with a shiny Buick or Ford in the driveway, they now had the means. <br> <br>Throughout the Victoria Era and into the early decades of the twentieth century, vacationing was a distinctly upper class pursuit. While the masses sweltered through the summer months in the inner city, high society retired to resorts and grand hotels at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Saratoga Springs, New York; Mackinaw Island, Michigan; and the like. Had they the money to stay in such luxury, it&#x2019;s doubtful the new breed of footloose wage earners would have been welcome. Instead, America&#x2019;s middle class took to the road. With practically no tourist infrastructure of inexpensive hotels or motels in existence, vacation destinations were limited. Out of necessity, leisure travelers took to tenting. To these free-wheelers, it didn&#x2019;t much matter whether the ideal camping spot was in a national park or farmer&#x2019;s field as long as it was far from the crowded, noisy city. Inexpensive and liberating, �auto camping&#x201d; was the rage, and L.L. fine-tuned his catalog to meet the needs of the �tin can tourist.&#x201d; <br> <br>L.L.'s selection process for new items for his catalog was not based on market surveys or merchandising analyses. He simply went with his gut, and with is personal experience. If he used and approved of a product while on one of his hunting and fishing trips, it stood a good chance of getting in. Sometimes a product was developed in-house and then field-tested until the kinks worked out. Other times, as with the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Blanket, he simply offered another manufacturer&#x2019;s product. The particulars behind L.L.&#x2019;s decisions on product placement in the early years are usually unknown. He wasn&#x2019;t much for record keeping and even less inclined toward noting his thoughts on paper. From our perspective, a hundred years after he went out on a limb to sell a new boot, L.L.&#x2019;s marketing skills seem to have sprung up fully formed. For such an outgoing public figure, to this day he engenders some degree of mystery. Much of what we do know about him is reflected from oral histories and accounts kept by the people who worked or hunted with him. Justin Williams, a longtime Bean employee in the early days, provided such a mirror. His recollection of a particular duck hunting trip in the late-1930s gives us a glimpse of product development, L.L.-style: <br> <br>�I had this old duck-call that I got around 1938 or so�one of the best ever made,&#x201d; said Williams. �L.L. and Danny Snow were in one blind and I was in another with the dog. So I got this old duck-call out and used it. Within a few minutes there must have been 500 ducks flying around the blinds. I mean the sky was filled with ducks. L.L. was standing there in shock, and &#x2019;til the day he died, he never got over it. You can believe that the next fall he had duck-calls in his catalog � patterned after the one I used that day.&#x201d; <br>Williams also witnessed what happened when one of L.L.&#x2019;s field tests went awry. In this case, L.L. was trying out a fancy new fishing rod pressed on him by a salesman for possible inclusion in the catalog. The fact that several other outfitters had placed big orders for the rod didn&#x2019;t impress L.L. �He took the rod on a fishing trip, hooked onto a big fish, the rod snapped in half and went overboard. That was the end of that,&#x201d; said Williams. <br> <br>�It wasn&#x2019;t easy to sell to L.L.,&#x201d; recalled Williams. �He had to see the truth of things for himself. If he put a product in the catalog, you can bet it was tested and was worth having, and no doubt about it at all. He started building a reputation for that right from the beginning.&#x201d; <br></p><h2>Wild Bunch Women, First Edition</h2><p>Explore the lives of the pistol-packing, hell-raising, high-spirited gals who hung out with Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch outlaw gang. <br></p><p>Explore the lives of the pistol-packing, hell-raising, high-spirited gals who traveled with Butch Cassidy's notorious Wild Bunch gang.

So began the biggest evacuation of art and antiquities in history. As the Germans neared Paris in 1940, the French raced to move the masterpieces still further south, then again and again during the war, crisscrossing the southwest of France. Throughout the German occupation, the museum staff fought to keep the priceless treasures out of the hands of Hitler and his henchmen, often risking their lives to protect the country's artistic heritage.</p> <p>Thus a story that features as a vignette in the George Clooney film <i>The Monuments Men</i> is given the full-length treatment it demands.

And yet most of these discussions center on the issue of predestination or on whether particular people agree with the five points of Calvinism. Daniel Montgomery and Timothy Paul Jones think it's time to rescue the theology of the Reformers from stale scholasticizing and to declare anew the intoxicating joy of the gospel they&nbsp;proclaimed.&nbsp;<br>PROOF stands for planned grace, resurrecting grace, outrageous grace, overcoming grace, and forever grace. The authors offer proof of God's grace on which people can stand against the attacks of cheap grace and legalism that have led many of God's people to lose sight of the freedom and joy of the gospel. And this proof is intoxicating---it's like a 200-proof drink that will leave you spiritually staggering at its effect on your life. God's grace not only declares us 'not guilty!' in his presence, it changes our relationship with God---forever.</p><p>In PROOF Daniel Montgomery and Timothy Paul Jones paint a multifaceted picture of grace that is refreshing to the soul, edifying to the church, and magnetic to those who have experienced that grace first hand. --Ed Stetzer, President, LifeWay Research<br><br> Don't let the title PROOF fool you: this is not a traditional book about apologetics. It is a book that works out how Christians themselves are the "proof" of God's grace. Instead of viewing robust biblical teaching as a deadening weight on vital Christian living, these two authors are busy finding freedom through the intoxicating joy of irresistible grace (as the subtitle puts it). The detailed endnotes will satisfy more intellectual readers, but the rest of the book will prove a great help to the rest of us who want to learn in experience how some of the central truths of the gospel transform not only our thinking but our lives. --D. A. Carson, Research Professor, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br> PROOF is one of the most well-reasoned and heart-engaging presentations of the Reformed faith I have read since becoming a Christian in 1968. Rooted in the history of theology, faithful to the text of Scripture, and accessible to a contemporary audience, these brothers throw the curtains wide open on the contours and grandeur of the gospel. --Scotty Smith, Teacher-in-Residence, West End Community Church<br><br> PROOF is biblical, forceful, winsome, and clear about who God is, how God works, and what God wants. Daniel and Timothy have given us a treasure! --Darrin Patrick, Pastor, The Journey<br><br> A book on the doctrines of grace that delights as much as it challenges? That exhilarates as much as it informs? That entertains as it enlightens? Be still my beating heart. ... PROOF is a rare breed indeed. Get it, savor it, let it bowl you over with the spectacular grace of God. --Jared Wilson, author of The Storytelling God<br><br> This book demonstrates a wealth of reflection on both modern and ancient sources, helping us re-discover the scandal of the gospel. --J.D. Greear, author of Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart<br><br> Daniel and Timothy will take you on a journey of grace in a way that you've never lived it before! --Gregg R. Allison, Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br> By unpacking the doctrines of grace in a fresh way, PROOF gives to the twenty-first century Christians a potent and powerful summary of what God has done for sinners. --Phillip Holmes, Vice President, Reformed African-American Network<br><br> PROOF is a fresh, new approach to the historical doctrines of grace. It will refresh and encourage the veteran learner and provide substance without the complicated jargon for the novice.&nbsp; --Trillia Newbell, author of United: Captured by God's Vision for Diversity.<br><br> Sadly, the doctrines of grace have often been used to score theological points. But PROOF shows how grace changes lives and brings joy. --Tim Chester, Associate Director, Porterbrook Seminary<br><br> At the end of PROOF you will walk away with a comprehensive knowledge of grace, and even more importantly, with a heart of worship for the Grace-Giver. --Flame, Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist, ClearSightMusic.com <br><br> Modern believers, who often unknowingly swing from license to legalism in their attempts to please God, need this joyous proclamation of the plan of salvation. This is a wonderful way of introducing the Canons of Dort to the heirs of the Me Generation. --Eric Redmond, Professor in Residence, New Canaan Baptist Church<br><br> If predestination has often felt stodgy and stifling, this book's for you. PROOF is not your standard portrayal of Reformed theology. It's unlike anything I've come across before. The style is engaging, the stories are captivating, the logic is compelling, and best of all the theology is rock solid and biblically faithful. Trust me, you'll love this book (even when you don't agree with it!).--Sam Storms, Lead Pastor, Bridgeway Church<br><br> Pastorally wise and academically rigorous, ... PROOF will pull you into the conversation and press you to consider afresh the biblical text and your own experience of God's grace. --J. Michael Thigpen, Executive Director, Evangelical Theological Society<br><br> PROOF contrasts true grace with our typical perception of grace in a way that will drive souls to experience freedom, joy, and worship. --Rebekah Hannah, Columbia University Christian Union Ministry Fellow<br><br> PROOF is a gift that not only stirred my affections toward Christ but also overwhelmed me with the continual and sustaining work of the Gospel in our lives. --John Bryson, Pastor, Fellowship Memphis, Acts 29 Executive Board Member<br><br> Daniel Montgomery doesn't just understand grace. ... No, grace arrested him, then grace tutored him, and now grace compels him to help others stand amazed. --Dave Harvey, Pastor, Four Oaks Community Church<br><br> PROOF paints a powerful picture that the gospel is not a cheap bucket of grace that sits at the foot of the cross. Rather, the gospel is an ever-flowing, deep river of irresistible grace that flows from the foot of the cross. --Brian Croft, Senior Pastor, Auburndale Baptist Church<br><br> PROOF is engaging, memorably written and full of tight, biblical thinking. This is deep, soul-nourishing theology restated for a new generation. --Greg Gilbert, co-author of What is the Mission of the Church?<br><br> Daniel and Timothy ground their book in the truth of Scripture and call for mystery, paradox, beauty, community, and mission to become a regular part of our grammar regarding grace. I cannot wait to get this book into our people's hands! --Kevin Cawley, Pastor, Redeemer Fellowship<p>Daniel Montgomery is founding pastor of Sojourn Community Church, a multi-site congregation with three campuses in Louisville, Kentucky and one in New Albany, Indiana.

Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against &#x201c;big government&#x201d; led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefs&#x2014;that taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedom&#x2014;are sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalin&#x2019;s Russia and Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible &#x201c;philanthropy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the <i>Citizens United</i> decision&#x2014;a case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dark Money</i> is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.</p><p><b>Jane Mayer</b> is a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker </i>and the author of three bestselling and critically acclaimed narrative nonfiction books.

The family patriarch, Fred Chase Koch, founder of the family oil business, developed lucrative business relationships with both of their regimes in the 1930s.<br><br>According to family lore, Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch printer and publisher who settled in the small town of Quanah, Texas, just south of the Oklahoma border, where he owned a weekly newspaper and print shop. Quanah, which was named for the last American Comanche chief, Quanah Parker, still retained its frontier aura when Fred was born there in 1900. Bright and eager to get out from under his overbearing old-world father, Fred once ran away to live with the Comanches as a boy. Later, he crossed the country for college, transferring from Rice in Texas to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, he earned a degree in chemical engineering and joined the boxing team. Early photographs show him as a tall, formally dressed young man with glasses, a tuft of unruly curls, and a self-confident, defiant expression.<br><br>In 1927, Fred, who was an inveterate tinkerer, invented an improved process for extracting gasoline from crude oil. But as he would later tell his sons bitterly and often, America&#x2019;s major oil companies regarded him as a business threat and shut him out of the industry, suing him and his customers in 1929 for patent infringement. Koch regarded the monopolistic patents invoked by the major oil companies as anticompetitive and unfair. The fight appears to be an early version of the Kochs&#x2019; later opposition to &#x201c;corporate cronyism&#x201d; in which they contend that the government and big business collaborate unfairly. In Fred Koch&#x2019;s eye, he was an outsider fighting a corrupt system.<br><br>Koch fought back in the courts for more than fifteen years, finally winning a $1.5 million settlement. He correctly suspected that his opponents bribed at least one presiding judge, an incompetent lush who left the case in the hands of a crooked clerk. &#x201c;The fact that the judge was bribed completely altered their view of justice,&#x201d; one longtime family employee suggests. &#x201c;They believe justice can be bought, and the rules are for chumps.&#x201d; Meanwhile, crippled by lawsuits in America during this period, Koch took his innovative refining method abroad.<br><br>He had already helped build a refinery in Great Britain after World War I with Charles de Ganahl, a mentor. At the time, the Russians supplied England with fuel, which led to the Russians seeking his expertise as they set up their own oil refineries after the Bolshevik Revolution.<br><br>At first, according to family lore, Koch tore up the telegram from the Soviet Union asking for his help. He said he didn&#x2019;t want to work for Communists and didn&#x2019;t trust them to pay him. But after securing an agreement to get paid in advance, he overcame his philosophical reservations. In 1930, his company, then called Winkler-Koch, began training Russian engineers and helping Stalin&#x2019;s regime set up fifteen modern oil refineries under the first of Stalin&#x2019;s five-year plans. The program was a success, forming the backbone of the future Russian petroleum industry. The oil trade brought crucial hard currency into the Soviet Union, enabling it to modernize other industries. Koch was reportedly paid $500,000, a princely sum during America&#x2019;s Great Depression. But by 1932, facing growing domestic demand, Soviet officials decided it would be more advantageous to copy the technology and build future refineries themselves. Fred Koch continued to provide technical assistance to the Soviets as they constructed one hundred plants, according to one report, but the advisory work was less profitable.<br><br>What happened next has been excised from the official corporate history of Koch Industries. After mentioning the company&#x2019;s work in the Soviet Union, the bulk of which ended in 1932, the corporate history skips ahead to 1940, when it says Fred Koch decided to found a new company, Wood River Oil &amp; Refining. Charles Koch is equally vague in his book The Science of Success. He notes only that his father&#x2019;s company &#x201c;enjoyed its first real financial success during the early years of the Great Depression&#x201d; by &#x201c;building plants abroad, especially in the Soviet Union.&#x201d;<br><br>A controversial chapter is missing. After leaving the U.S.S.R., Fred Koch turned to Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Third Reich. Hitler became chancellor in 1933, and soon after, his government oversaw and funded massive industrial expansion, including the buildup of Germany&#x2019;s capacity to manufacture fuel for its growing military ambitions. During the 1930s, Fred Koch traveled frequently to Germany on oil business. Archival records document that in 1934 Winkler-Koch Engineering of Wichita, Kansas, as Fred&#x2019;s firm was then known, provided the engineering plans and began overseeing the construction of a massive oil refinery owned by a company on the Elbe River in Hamburg.<br><br>The refinery was a highly unusual venture for Koch to get involved with at that moment in Germany. Its top executive was a notorious American Nazi sympathizer named William Rhodes Davis whose extensive business dealings with Hitler would eventually end in accusations by a federal prosecutor that he was an &#x201c;agent of influence&#x201d; for the Nazi regime. In 1933, Davis proposed the purchase and conversion of an existing German oil storage facility in Hamburg, owned by a company called Europ�ische Tanklager A.G., or Eurotank, into a massive refinery. At the time, Hitler&#x2019;s military aims, and his need for more fuel, were already well-known. Davis&#x2019;s plan was to ship crude petroleum to Germany, refine it, and then sell it to the German military. The president of the American bank with which Davis dealt refused to have anything to do with the deal, because it was seen as supporting the Nazi military buildup, but others extended the credit. After lining up the American financing, Davis needed the Third Reich&#x2019;s backing. To gain it, he first had to convince German industrialists of his support for Hitler. In his effort to ingratiate himself, Davis opened an early meeting with Hermann Schmitz, the chairman of I.G. Farben&#x2014;the powerful and well-connected chemical company that soon after produced the lethal gas for the concentration camps&#x2019; death chambers&#x2014;by saluting him with a Nazi &#x201c;Heil Hitler.&#x201d; When these efforts didn&#x2019;t produce the green light he sought, Davis sent messages directly to Hitler, eventually securing a meeting in which the f�hrer walked in and ordered his henchmen to approve the deal. On Hitler&#x2019;s orders, the Third Reich&#x2019;s economic ministers supported Davis&#x2019;s construction of the refinery. In his biography of Davis, Dale Harrington draws on eyewitness accounts to describe Hitler as declaring to his skeptical henchmen, &#x201c;Gentlemen, I have reviewed Mr. Davis&#x2019;s proposition and it sounds feasible, and I want the bank to finance it.&#x201d; Harrington writes that during the next few years Davis met at least half a dozen more times with Hitler and on one occasion asked him to personally autograph a copy of Mein Kampf for his wife. According to Harrington, by the end of 1933 Davis was &#x201c;deeply committed to Nazism&#x201d; and exhibited a noticeable &#x201c;dislike for Jews.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1934, Davis turned to Fred Koch&#x2019;s company, Winkler-Koch, for help in executing his German business plan. Under Fred Koch&#x2019;s direction, the refinery was finished by 1935. With the capacity to process a thousand tons of crude oil a day, the third-largest refinery in the Third Reich was created by the collaboration between Davis and Koch. Significantly, it was also one of the few refineries in Germany, according to Harrington, that could &#x201c;produce the high-octane gasoline needed to fuel fighter planes. Naturally,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;Eurotank would do most of its business with the German military.&#x201d; Thus, he concludes, the American venture became &#x201c;a key component of the Nazi war machine.&#x201d;<br><br>Historians expert in German industrial history concur. The development of the German fuel industry &#x201c;was hugely, hugely important&#x201d; to Hitler&#x2019;s military ambitions, according to the Northwestern University professor Peter Hayes. &#x201c;Hitler set out to create &#x2018;autarchy,&#x2019; or economic self-sufficiency,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Gottfried Feder, the German official in charge of the program, reasoned that even though Germany would have to import crude oil, it would be able to save foreign exchange by refining the products itself.&#x201d;<br><br>In the run-up to the war, Davis profited richly from the arrangement, engaging in elaborate scams to keep the crude oil imports flowing into Germany despite Britain&#x2019;s blockade. When World War II began, the high-octane fuel was used in bombing raids by German pilots. Like Davis, the Koch family benefited from the venture. Raymond Stokes, director of the Centre for Business History at the University of Glasgow in Scotland and co-author of a history of the German oil industry during the Nazi years, Faktor �l (The oil factor), which documents the company&#x2019;s role, says, &#x201c;Winkler-Koch benefited directly from this project, which was designed to help enable the fuel policy of the Third Reich.&#x201d;<br><br>Fred Koch often traveled to Germany during these years, and according to family lore he was supposed to have been on the fatal May 1937 transatlantic flight of the Hindenburg, but at the last minute he got delayed. In late 1938, as World War II approached and Hitler&#x2019;s aims were unmistakable, he wrote admiringly about fascism in Germany, and elsewhere, drawing an invidious comparison with America under Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal. &#x201c;Although nobody agrees with me, I am of the opinion that the only sound countries in the world are Germany, Italy, and Japan, simply because they are all working and working hard,&#x201d; he wrote in a letter to a friend. Koch added, &#x201c;The laboring people in those countries are proportionately much better off than they are any place else in the world. When you contrast the state of mind of Germany today with what it was in 1925 you begin to think that perhaps this course of idleness, feeding at the public trough, dependence on government, etc., with which we are afflicted is not permanent and can be overcome.&#x201d;<br><br>When the United States entered World War II in 1941, family members say that Fred Koch tried to enlist in the U.S. military. Instead, the government directed him to use his chemical engineering prowess to help refine high-octane fuel for the American warplanes. Meanwhile, in an ironic turn, the Hamburg refinery that Winkler-Koch built became an important target of Allied bombing raids. On June 18, 1944, American B-17s finally destroyed it. The human toll of the bombing raids on Hamburg was almost unimaginable. In all, some forty-two thousand civilians were killed during the long and intense Allied campaign against Hamburg&#x2019;s crucial industrial targets.<br><br>Fred Koch&#x2019;s willingness to work with the Soviets and the Nazis was a major factor in creating the Koch family&#x2019;s early fortune. By the time he met his future wife, Mary Robinson, at a polo match in 1932, the oilman&#x2019;s work for Stalin had put him well on his way to becoming exceedingly wealthy.<br><br>Robinson, a twenty-four-year-old graduate of Wellesley College, was tall, slender, and beautiful, with blond hair, blue eyes, and an expression of amusement often captured in family photographs. The daughter of a prominent physician from Kansas City, Missouri, she had grown up in a more cosmopolitan milieu. Koch, who was seven years older than she, was so smitten he married her a month after they met.<br><br>Soon, the couple commissioned the most fashionable architect in the area to build an imposing Gothic-style stone mansion on a large compound on the outskirts of Wichita, Kansas, where Winkler-Koch was based. Reflecting their rising social status, the estate was baronial despite the flat and empty prairie surrounding it, with stables, a polo ring, a kennel for hunting dogs, a swimming pool and wading pool, a circular drive, and stone-terraced gardens. Some of the best craftsmen in the country created decorative flourishes such as wrought-iron railings and a stone fireplace carved with a whimsical snowflake motif. Within a few years, the Kochs also purchased the sprawling Spring Creek Ranch near Reece, Kansas, where Fred, who loved science and genetics, bred and raised cattle. Family photographs show the couple looking glamorous and patrician, hosting picnics and pool parties, and riding on horseback, dressed in jodhpurs and polo gear, surrounded by packs of jolly friends.<br><br>In the first eight years of their marriage, the couple had four sons: Frederick, known by the family as Freddie, was born in 1933, Charles was born in 1935, and twins, David and William, were born in 1940. With their father frequently traveling and their mother preoccupied with social and cultural pursuits, the boys were largely entrusted to a series of nannies and housekeepers.<br><br>It is unclear what Fred Koch&#x2019;s views of Hitler were during the 1930s, beyond his preference for the country&#x2019;s work ethic in comparison with the nascent welfare state in America. But he was enamored enough of the German way of life and thinking that he employed a German governess for his first two sons, Freddie and Charles. At the time, Freddie was a small boy, and Charles still in diapers. The nanny&#x2019;s iron rule terrified the little boys, according to a family acquaintance. In addition to being overbearing, she was a fervent Nazi sympathizer, who frequently touted Hitler&#x2019;s virtues. Dressed in a starched white uniform and pointed nurse&#x2019;s hat, she arrived with a stash of gruesome German children&#x2019;s books, including the Victorian classic Der Struwwelpeter, that featured sadistic consequences for misbehavior ranging from cutting off one child&#x2019;s thumbs to burning another to death. The acquaintance recalled that the nurse had a commensurately harsh and dictatorial approach to child rearing. She enforced a rigid toilet-training regimen requiring the boys to produce morning bowel movements precisely on schedule or be force-fed castor oil and subjected to enemas.<br><br>The despised governess ruled the nursery largely unchallenged for several years. In 1938, the two boys were left for months while their parents toured Japan, Burma, India, and the Philippines. Even when she was home, Mary Koch characteristically deferred to her husband, declining to intervene. &#x201c;My father was fairly tough with my mother,&#x201d; Bill Koch later told Vanity Fair. &#x201c;My mother was afraid of my father.&#x201d; Meanwhile, Fred Koch was often gone for months at a time, in Germany and elsewhere.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until 1940, the year the twins were born, when Freddie was seven and Charles five, that back in Wichita the German governess finally left the Koch family, apparently at her own initiative. Her reason for giving notice was that she was so overcome with joy when Hitler invaded France she felt she had to go back to the fatherland in order to join the f�hrer in celebration. What if any effect this early experience with authority had on Charles is impossible to know, but it&#x2019;s interesting that his lifetime preoccupation would become crusading against authoritarianism while running a business over which he exerted absolute control.<br><br>Fred Koch was himself a tough and demanding disciplinarian.

In his engaging, intelligent book, James Dinsmore has created the first comprehensive history of this abounding wildlife from the arrival of Euro-American explorers to the present day.<br><br>Based on a thorough search of hundreds of primary sources ranging from chronicles of military expeditions to field reports by early naturalists, first-person accounts by fur traders and hunters to up-to-date county checklists, A Country So Full of Game examines the dramatic encounters of humans with elk, black bears, passenger pigeons, bobcats, prairie-chickens, otters, and many more. Each chapter discusses the animal's status and distribution when explorers first arrived in Iowa, how it was hunted or trapped, how this exploitation affected its population, and what its current status is both in Iowa and nationally. Enhanced by Mark M�ller's distinctive drawings, commissioned for this book, the anecdotes evoke a sense of loss and wonder at the magic abundance of Iowa's wildlife.<br><br>Iowa has been changed more than, perhaps, any other state. We can mourn the disappearance of the bison and mountain lion while we marvel at the recent success of the wild turkey and white-tailed deer. Listening to James Dinsmore tell the story of wildlife in Iowa can open a window onto the future as other areas of our planet are increasingly altered by humans. A Country So Full of Game will allow all naturalists, both amateur and professional, hunter and biologist, to appreciate and learn from Iowa's diverse wild heritage.</p><p>James Dinsmore grew up in southern Mississippi and has lived in Ames since 1975. He is professor of animal ecology at Iowa State University.&#x201c;For years we have all heard various stories and myths regarding wildlife in Iowa during the early settlement of the state. James Dinsmore has provided a definitive document that carefully and clearly describes the wildlife elements of our natural heritage at the time of settlement. He has sprinkled in moments of humor and unique stories that provide interest and reflect the impact of our cultural heritage on our wild world.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gerry Schnepf</p><h2>Afterland</h2><p><i></i><br><br><b><i>Blade Runner </i>meets <i>The Handmaid's Tale </i>in this thrilling story of how far a mother will go to protect her son in a hostile world transformed by the sudden absence of men. </b><br><br>Cole and her twelve-year-old, Miles, are on the lam.

The authors were not canonized saints or <i>beati</i>, and their travels were not missionary journeys in the strict sense, but were more of the nature of political embassies. Nevertheless, they were servants of Christendom as few men have been. They give a first-hand authentic account of the first contact between Western Christendom and the Far East, and this at the moment when the whole oriental world from Korea to Hungary was being turned upside down and remade by one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of the world.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Henry Dawson</b> was a British historian and Catholic intellectual.

From the monarchical terror of the Middle Ages to the mangled Europe of the twenty-first century, <i>A People&#x2019;s History of Modern Europe</i> tracks the history of the continent through the deeds of those whom mainstream history tries to forget.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along the way, William A. Pelz examines the German peasant wars of Thomas M�ntzer, the bourgeoisie revolutions of the eighteenth century, the rise of the industrial worker in England, the turbulent journey of the Russian Soviets, the role of the European working class throughout the Cold War, and the revolutionary students in 1968. He then brings his story to the present day, where we continue to fight to forge an alternative to a heartless and often barbaric economic system.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As Germany and Greece argue over who owes what, with the very idea of Europe crumbling around them, Pelz&#x2019;s accessible, provocative history could not be timelier. Sure to resonate with fans of books like Howard Zinn&#x2019;s <i>A People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>, this people&#x2019;s history sweeps away the tired platitudes of the privileged and provides an opportunity to understand the story of Europe from the ground up.</p><p><b>William A. Pelz</b> is director of the Institute of Working Class History in Chicago and professor of history at Elgin Community College. His recent works include <i>Wilhelm Liebknecht and German Social Democracy</i>, <i>The Eugene V. Debs Reader</i>, and <i>Against Capitalism: The European Left on the March</i>.<br>&#x201c;<i>A People&#x2019;s History of Modern Europe</i> cuts through some of the myths . . . that shape perceptions about Europe in much of the English-speaking world. . . . Pelz&#x2019;s myth-busting clears the way for a sweeping account of historical developments from the Middle Ages to post-communist Europe. . . . But of course he gives them a history-from-below twist.&#x201d; (<i>Against the Current</i>)<br><br>"In this lively and engaging book, Pelz takes the reader through a thousand years of European history from below. This is the not the story of lords, kings and rulers. It is the story of the ordinary people of Europe and their struggles against those lords, kings and rulers, from the Middle Ages to the present day. Written in a lucid and accessible style, <i>A People's History of Modern Europe </i>is a fine introduction to the subject which will be appreciated by students and activists alike." (<i>Socialist History</i>)<br><br>"From the Peasants&#x2019; Revolt of 1381 to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Pelz presents a challenging alternative to the conventional narratives of European history, putting the sufferings and the resistance of working women (often written out of history) and men at the centre of the story. There are strikes, riots, mutinies and revolutions, but they are carefully entwined with economic structures and conflicts and with aspects of everyday life. Based on a wide range of sources, it gives us a comprehensive but concise account, illuminating its arguments with a mass of concrete detail." (<i>Ian Birchall, author of The Spectre of Babeuf</i>)<br><br>"Pelz&#x2019;s <i>A People&#x2019;s History of Modern Europe</i> is an alternative reading of modern European history, a sharp break with the standard commentaries on the subject. Beginning with the Middle Ages, the book is a fascinating journey across centuries towards the world as we experience it today in the 21st century. However, as distinct from the established names who figure most prominently in the popular accounts of this long period, it is the voice of the ordinary people, the less prominent figures, the women in particular, their ideas and actions, protests and sufferings that have gone into the making of this alternative narrative and therein lies the strength and uniqueness of the volume. A product of rigorous research, yet very comprehensive, it is a book of a different genre, which would remind the reader of A.L. Morton&#x2019;s <i>A People&#x2019;s History of England </i>and the writings of Eric Hobsbawm." (<i>Sobhanlal Datta Gupta, University of Calcutta</i>)<br><br>"This is a history of Europe that doesn&#x2019;t remove the Europeans. Here there are not only kings, presidents, institutions but the pulse of the people and social organizations that shaped Europe. A must-read." (<i>Raquel Varela, Universidade Nova de Lisboa</i>)<br><br>"This book is an exception to the rule that the winner takes all in historiography. It highlights the importance of the commoners which often is only shown in the dark corners of mainstream history books. From Hussetites, Levelellers and sans-cullotes to the women who defended the Paris Commune and the workers who occupied the shipyards during the Carnation revolution in Portugal. The author gives them their deserved place in history just like Howard Zinn did for the American people. Given the current climate of opinion with an overwhelmingly negative attitude towards the struggles of the commoners this book is a good lesson that resistance is often hard but also necessary and fruitful." (<i>Sjaak van der Velden, International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam</i>)<br><br>"The author puts his focus on the lives and historical impact of the common people, i.e. those excluded from power and wealth: peasants and serfs of the middle ages, workers during the Industrial Revolution, women in a patriarchic order that transcended different eras. This focus not only makes history relevant for contemporary debates on social justice, it also urges the reader to develop a critical approach towards sources, always asking who is represented and who is lost." (<i>Ralf Hoffrogge, Ruhr-Universit�t Bochum</i>)<br><br>"This book presents us European history as an exciting story of generations of people struggling for better living conditions, social and political rights, for emancipation. This struggles did not always led to immediate success but contributed to the general progress in the long run. This story has to be remembered and specifically considered now, when the very notions of enlightenment, progress and social change are becoming questioned. This means that there are quite a few struggles still ahead of us and we will have to draw inspiration from the experience and history of popular resistance and revolutions of the past." (<i>Boris Kagarlitsky, director of Institute for Globalization Studies and Social Movements</i>)<br><br>"A splendid antidote to the many European histories dominated by kings, businessmen and generals. It should be on the shelves of both academics and activists. . . .a lively and informative intellectual tour de force."

The plans of the distantly related humans on the rogue world Jevlen to eliminate their ancient Terran rivals and take over the Thurien system of worlds have been thwarted, but the mystery remains of how it was possible for the fleeing Jevlenese leaders to have been flung back across space and time to reappear at Minerva before the time of its destruction. Victor Hunt and a group of his colleagues travel to Thurien to conduct a joint investigation with the alien scientists into the strange physics of interconnectedness between the countless alternate universes that constitute ultimate reality. When their discoveries lead first to bizarre communication with bewildered counterparts in other universes, and thence to the possibility of physical travel, the notion is conceived of sending a mission back to the former world of Minerva with the startling objective of creating a new family of realities in which its destruction is avoided. But Imares Broghuilio, the deposed Jevlenese leader, along with several thousand dedicated followers with five heavily armed starships, are already there. And they have a score to settle.</p><p>James P. Hogan is a science fiction writer in the grand tradition, combining informed and accurate speculation from the cutting edge of science and technology with suspenseful story-telling and living, breathing characters. His first novel was greeted by Isaac Asimov with the rave, �Pure science fiction . . . Arthur Clarke, move over!� and his subsequent work quickly consolidated his reputation as a major SF author. He has written nearly twenty novels including <i>Cradle of Saturn</i> and <i>Bug</i><i> Park</i> (both Baen), the Giants series (Del Rey), the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Proteus Operation</i> and <i>Endgame</i> <i>Enigma</i> and the Prometheus Award Winner <i>The Multiplex Man.<br></i>In Hogan's intriguing fifth SF novel in the series that began with <i>Inherit the Stars</i> (1978), Earth has reestablished contact with the Ganymeans, an alien race that manipulated proto-humans into homo sapiens on Minerva, a planet that once occupied the region of the present asteroid belt. After the Ganymeans migrated to the Giants' Star 20 light-years from Earth, a war on Minerva caused by intelligences from an alternate reality&#x2014;one of an infinite number suggested by the Multiverse hypothesis&#x2014;led to the planet's destruction. Now, several decades into the 21st century, people on Earth have developed a means of exploring these realities, including one in which Minerva still exists, and mount a rescue mission to prevent the war on Minerva. While the need to establish the backstory slows the book's first half, Hogan does an excellent job of extrapolating the science from current theories of quantum physics. The second half moves briskly and logically to a satisfying climax, though the villain is straight out of James Bond. Readers who like their science hard will find this one a diamond. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has company: the leaders of Italy, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey, among others, are also avowed illiberals. What happened? Why did liberalism lose the support it once enjoyed? In <i>What Was Liberalism?,</i> James Traub returns to the origins of liberalism, in the aftermath of the American and French revolutions and in the works of such great thinkers as John Stuart Mill and Isaiah Berlin. <br>Although the first liberals were deeply skeptical of majority rule, the liberal faith adapted, coming to encompass belief in not only individual rights and free markets, but also state action to provide basic goods. By the second half of the twentieth century, liberalism had become the national creed of the most powerful country in the world. But this consensus did not last. Liberalism is now widely regarded as an antiquated doctrine. <i>What Was LIberalism? </i>reviews the evolution of the liberal idea over more than two centuries for lessons on how it can rebuild its majoritarian foundations.<br></p><p>James Traub has spent the last forty years as a journalist for American's leading publications, including the <i>New Yorker</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>.

Characteristic of his gentle guidance, he tells us not to be disturbed by the shadows surrounding our "little willingness" to learn from him, and not to despair because of our limitations. These cautions were the themes of two workshops presented at our center&#x2014;"Shadows of Limitation" and "Sweet Are the Uses of Adversity"&#x2014;that form the basis of this book. If we identify with the ego, our limitations become cause for comparison and judgment, and thereby impel us to seek ways to overcome the imperfections in our bodies and the world. This focus serves the ego's purpose of concealing the mind's decision for guilt, substituting a limited self for the unlimited Self of Christ. Identifying with the loving Presence of the Holy Spirit in our right minds, we recognize our self-defeating choice, thus allowing true correction to heal. We now look kindly on our imperfections, redefining them not as our reality but as mere detours on our journey home. These shadows of limitation become the contours of the classroom that Jesus uses to teach us his kind lessons of forgiveness. Thus do they ultimately fade in the light of the Atonement, in which we are all joined as the one perfect Son of God.</p><p>Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and one of the foremost teachers of A Course in Miracles, which he has been working with since 1973, when he joined Dr. Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and Dr. William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.

Through a consideration of the gestures, costuming, vocal techniques, and stagecraft developed by African American singers and dancers, Jayna Brown explains how these women shaped the movement and style of an emerging urban popular culture. In an era of U.S. and British imperialism, these women challenged and played with constructions of race, gender, and the body as they moved across stages and geographic space. They pioneered dance movements including the cakewalk, the shimmy, and the Charleston&#x2014;black dances by which the &#x201c;New Woman&#x201d; defined herself. These early-twentieth-century performers brought these dances with them as they toured across the United States and around the world, becoming cosmopolitan subjects more widely traveled than many of their audiences. <p></p><p>Investigating both well-known performers such as Ada Overton Walker and Josephine Baker and lesser-known artists such as Belle Davis and Valaida Snow, Brown weaves the histories of specific singers and dancers together with incisive theoretical insights. She describes the strange phenomenon of blackface performances by women, both black and white, and she considers how black expressive artists navigated racial segregation. Fronting the &#x201c;picaninny choruses&#x201d; of African American child performers who toured Britain and the Continent in the early 1900s, and singing and dancing in <i>The Creole Show</i> (1890), <i>Darktown Follies </i>(1913), and <i>Shuffle Along</i> (1921), black women variety-show performers of the early twentieth century paved the way for later generations of African American performers. Brown shows not only how these artists influenced transnational ideas of the modern woman but also how their artistry was an essential element in the development of jazz.</p></p><p>"Babylon Girls is a brilliant book. Consistently pushing multiple fields in new directions, Jayna Brown reveals the centrality of black female performance culture in the making of transatlantic modernity. Her incredibly valuable book demonstrates how African Americans moved in resilient and unpredictable ways--both geographically and performatively--during the early twentieth century."--Daphne A. Brooks, author of Bodies in Dissent: Spectacular Performances of Race and Freedom, 1850-1910 <p>"The most exciting piece of scholarship that I've read in ages, Babylon Girls succeeds as an extremely ambitious, meticulously researched, brilliantly theorized cultural history.

Zoos have their ardent supporters and their vocal detractors. And while we all have opinions on <i>what</i> zoos do, few people consider <i>how</i> they do it. Irus Braverman draws on more than seventy interviews conducted with zoo managers and administrators, as well as animal activists, to offer a glimpse into the otherwise unknown complexities of zooland. <i>Zooland</i> begins and ends with the story of Timmy, the oldest male gorilla in North America, to illustrate the dramatic transformations of zoos since the 1970s. Over these decades, modern zoos have transformed themselves from places created largely for entertainment to globally connected institutions that emphasize care through conservation and education. Zoos naturalize their spaces, classify their animals, and produce spectacular experiences for their human visitors. Zoos name, register, track, and allocate their animals in global databases. Zoos both abide by and create laws and industry standards that govern their captive animals. Finally, zoos intensely govern the reproduction of captive animals, carefully calculating the life and death of these animals, deciding which of them will be sustained and which will expire. <i>Zooland</i> takes readers behind the exhibits into the world of zoo animals and their caretakers. And in so doing, it turns its gaze back on us to make surprising interconnections between our understandings of the human and the nonhuman.</p><p>Irus Braverman is Associate Professor of Law and Adjunct Professor of Geography at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. She is the author of <i>Planted Flags: Trees, Land, and Law in Israel/Palestine</i> (2009)."[Zooland] gives a glimpse of zoos, in the same way that zoos give a glimpse of nature: a quick look behind the scenes, at a slightly upward angle, inspiring respect." (Daniel Engber <i><i>Slate Magazine</i></i>)<br><br>"Irus Braverman's recent book <i>Zooland</i> is a wonderful read on a topic that is of both historical and current interest&#x2015;zoos . . . Braverman does an admirable job of walking the line between zoo advocacy and condemnation and tracing an important historical and cultural shift in the self-understandings of those involved in the increasingly bureaucratized and professionalized institutional care and control of zoo animals. One gets a sense from the book and the voices of her interview subjects that zoo professionals really do care about these animals . . . The book puts forward their perspective fairly and with a great deal of compassion. On the other hand, it is steadfast in highlighting the contradictions and problems with zoo messaging that many of us have experienced and have probably only dimly perceived on a visit to our local zoo." (Angela Fernandez <i><i>Jotwell: The Journal of Things We Like (Lots)</i></i>)<br><br>"[Braverman's] accounts of record keeping, a fairly new practice, and the laws regulating the keeping of zoo animals as well as the complexity of deciding which animals will be allowed to reproduce, will be eye opening for most readers." (Nancy Bent <i><i>BOOKLIST</i></i>)<br><br>"Braverman's <i>Zooland</i> engages with the new zoos of the 21st century. It is an innovative book, adding a new chapter to understanding how zoos evolve . . . Drawing upon Foucault, Braverman's ethnography of North American zoos presents an innovative, bold, and in-depth study of how zoos are conceived, managed, organized, spatialized, recorded, managed, and governed." (Eve Darien-Smith <i><i> Political &amp; Legal Anthropology Review (PoLAR)</i></i>)<br><br>"Zoos can provide a valuable service to society, but the pursuit of profit has their own drawbacks. <i>Zooland: The Institution of Captivity</i> explores the modern state of the zoo, as forces within the community paint two very different pictures: the zoo has a preserver and educator on the topic of wildlife, and zoo as the carnival, exploiting animals for profit. With sixty interviews with many people voicing their ideas on the topic, <i>Zooland</i> is scholarly and much recommended addition to any wildlife and social issues collection." (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Beautifully written, finely researched, astutely argued, <i>Zooland</i> offers a wealth of stories, data, and views to understand the potent work of zoos and their life-propagating messiness, astonishing technologies, and detailed ordering of their captive subjects deemed wild." (Donna Haraway <i>University of California at Santa Cruz, author of <i>When Species Meet</i></i>)<br><br>"Brave and important, this new work puts the governance of animals at the heart of the debates about governance more broadly. <i>Zooland</i> opens up our understandings of social and spatial management, surveillance, classification and control, helping us understand the impact of such human social processes on nonhumans." (David Murakami Wood <i>Queen's University, Canada, author of <i>Globalization and Surveillance: The Watched World</i></i>)<br><br>"[Zooland] builds a thorough depiction of the history and contemporary work and goals of zoos and explores the nature of wildness, care, and power by interviewing zoo professionals, animal rights activists, and others, as well as diving into a wide range of legal and scholarly literature from fields as diverse as geography, sociology, animal sciences, and philosophy." (J. R. Page <i><i>CHOICE</i></i>)<br><br>"The book's most striking chapters go beyond animal bodies to consider zoo databases, regulations, and the new technologies that bring animal bodies into being. Braverman's exploration of the backstage practices of zooland makes for fascinating reading . . . <i>Zooland</i> stands as an admirable achievement and a welcome addition to the literature on zoos, as well as showing how biopolitics encompass more than human life. Braverman's research really gets to the heart of the paradox that the institution of captivity is an expression of care, even if that care justifies death and suffering." (Franklin Ginn <i><i>Environment and Planning D</i></i>)<br><br>"Zoos have increasingly become an interconnected network of spaces in which animal populations can be managed and sustained despite the threats they face in the wild. This network is the 'Zooland' of the book's title, and its advocates portray it as a kind of Noah's Ark, 'containing the animals safely until the storm passes'. This is the essence of how modern zoos see themselves, one distilled by Braverman, a scholar of law and geography, in interviews with more than 70 zoo administrators and activists from both sides. <i>Zooland</i> is an insightful catalogue of zoos' claims and contradictions."

But where traditional labor action failed, a new approach was more successful. With the aid of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, a $300 billion pension fund, workers led a shareholder revolt that unseated three of Burd's boardroom allies.<br>In <i>The Rise of the Working-Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon</i>, David Webber uses cases such as Safeway's to shine a light on labor's most potent remaining weapon: its multitrillion-dollar pension funds. Outmaneuvered at the bargaining table and under constant assault in Washington, state houses, and the courts, worker organizations are beginning to exercise muscle through markets. Shareholder activism has been used to divest from anti-labor companies, gun makers, and tobacco; diversify corporate boards; support Occupy Wall Street; force global warming onto the corporate agenda; create jobs; and challenge outlandish CEO pay. Webber argues that workers have found in labor's capital a potent strategy against their exploiters. He explains the tactic's surmountable difficulties even as he cautions that corporate interests are already working to deny labor's access to this powerful and underused tool.<br><i>The Rise of the Working-Class Shareholder </i>is a rare good-news story for American workers, an opportunity hiding in plain sight. Combining legal rigor with inspiring narratives of labor victory, Webber shows how workers can wield their own capital to reclaim their strength.</p><p>David Webber is a law professor at Boston University, where he won the 2017 Michael Melton Award for Teaching Excellence.

He went on to study art at the Slade School, and literature at University College in London. Chesterton wrote a great deal of poetry, as well as works of social and literary criticism. Among his most notable books are &#34;The Man Who Was Thursday&#34;, a metaphysical thriller, and &#34;The Everlasting Man&#34;, a history of humankind&#39;s spiritual progress. After Chesterton converted to Catholicism in 1922, he wrote mainly on religious topics such as &#34;Orthodoxy&#34; and &#34;Heretics&#34;. Chesterton is most known for creating the famous priest-detective character Father Brown, who first appeared in &#34;The Innocence of Father Brown&#34;. Chesterton died in 1936 at the age of 62.<b>Eugenics</b> <br>"There exists to-day a scheme of action, a school thought, as collective and unmistakable as any of those by whose grouping alone we can make any outline of history. . . . I know that it numbers many disciples whose intentions are entirely innocent and humane; and who would be sincerely astonished at my describing it as I do. But that is only because evil always wins through the strength of its splendid dupes; and there has in all ages been a disastrous alliance between abnormal innocence and abnormal sin. . . . But Eugenics itself does exist for those who have sense enough to see that ideas exist; and Eugenics itself, in large quantities or small, coming quickly or coming slowly, urged from good motives or bad, applied to a thousand people or applied to three, Eugenics itself is a thing no more to be bargained about than poisoning." <p><b>Institutionalizing the Unfit</b> <br>"I will call it the Feeble-Minded Bill, both for brevity and because the description is strictly accurate. It is, quite simply and literally, a Bill for incarcerating as madmen those whom no doctor will consent to call mad. It is enough if some doctor or other may happen to call them weak-minded." </p><p><b>Forced sterilization</b> <br>"Indeed one Eugenist, Mr. A. H. Huth, actually had a sense of humour, and admitted this. He thinks a great deal of good could be done with a surgical knife, if we would only turn him loose with one. And this may be true. A great deal of good could be done with a loaded revolver, in the hands of a judicious student of human nature." </p><p><b>The Tyranny of Science</b> <br>"The thing that really is trying to tyrannise through government is Science. The thing that really does use the secular arm is Science. And the creed that really is levying tithes and capturing schools, the creed that really is enforced by fine and imprisonment, the creed that really is proclaimed not in sermons but in statutes, and spread not by pilgrims but by policemen&#x2039;that creed is the great but disputed system of thought which began with Evolution and has ended in Eugenics." </p><p><b>Eugenic Motives</b> <br>"There is no reason in Eugenics, but there is plenty of motive. Its supporters are highly vague about its theory, but they will be painfully practical about its practice. And while I reiterate that many of its more eloquent agents are probably quite innocent instruments, there are some, even among Eugenists, who by this time know what they are doing." </p><p><b>The Poor Man and his Child</b> <br>"There is one human thing left it is much harder to take from him. Debased by him and his betters, it is still something brought out of Eden, where God made him a demigod: it does not depend on money and but little on time. He can create in his own image. The terrible truth is in the heart of a hundred legends and mysteries. As Jupiter could be hidden from all-devouring Time, as the Christ Child could be hidden from Herod&#x2039;so the child unborn is still hidden from the omniscient oppressor. He who lives not yet, he and he alone is left; and they seek his life to take it away." </p><p><b>The Rich Begin To Fear the Poor</b> <br>"So at least it seemed, doubtless in a great degree subconsciously, to the man who had wagered all his wealth on the usefulness of the poor to the rich and the dependence of the rich on the poor. The time came at last when the rather reckless breeding in the abyss below ceased to be a supply, and began to be something like a wastage; ceased to be something like keeping foxhounds, and began alarmingly to resemble a necessity of shooting foxes." </p><p><b>Scientific Regimentation</b> <br>"That is the problem, and that is why there is now no protection against Eugenic or any other experiments. If the men who took away beer as an unlawful pleasure had paused for a moment to define the lawful pleasures, there might be a different situation. If the men who had denied one liberty had taken the opportunity to affirm other liberties, there might be some defence for them. But it never occurs to them to admit any liberties at all. It never so much as crosses their minds. Hence the excuse for the last oppression will always serve as well for the next oppression; and to that tyranny there can be no end." </p><p><b>Socialism</b> <br>"In short, people decided that it was impossible to achieve any of the good of Socialism, but they comforted themselves by achieving all the bad. All that official discipline, about which the Socialists themselves were in doubt or at least on the defensive, was taken over bodily by the Capitalists. They have now added all the bureaucratic tyrannies of a Socialist state to the old plutocratic tyrannies of a Capitalist State." </p><p><b>The Working Classes</b> <br>"The working classes have no reserves of property with which to defend their relics of religion. They have no religion with which to sanctify and dignify their property. Above all, they are under the enormous disadvantage of being right without knowing it. They hold their sound principles as if they were sullen prejudices. They almost secrete their small property as if it were stolen property. Often a poor woman will tell a magistrate that she sticks to her husband, with the defiant and desperate air of a wanton resolved to run away from her husband. Often she will cry as hopelessly, and as it were helplessly, when deprived of her child as if she were a child deprived of her doll."</p></p><h2>High Hurdles Collection One</h2><p>Fourteenyearold D.J.

His legacy resides as much in the careers he ruined as the 445 victories&#x2014;including five Tour de France wins and all the monument races&#x2014;he amassed in his own right. So dominant had Merckx become by 1973 that he was ordered to stay away from the Tour for the good of the event. Stage 17 of the 1969 Tour de France perfectly illustrates his untouchable brilliance. Already wearing the yellow jersey on the col du Tourmalet, the Tour's most famous peak, Merckx powered clear and rode the last 140 kilometers to the finish-line in jaw-dropping solitude, eight minutes ahead of his nearest competitor. Merckx's era has been called cycling's Golden Age. It was full of memorable characters who, at any other time, would all have gone on to become legends, yet Merckx's phenomenal career overshadowed them all. How did he achieve such incredible success? And how did his rivals really feel about him? Merckx failed drug tests three times in his career&#x2014;were they really set ups as he claimed? And what of the crash that killed Merckx's pacer Fernand Wambst, which Merckx claimed deeply affected him psychologically and physically? Or the attack by a spectator in 1975? This first comprehensive biography of Merckx in English will finally expose the truth behind this legendary man.

It is a masterfully written tragicomedy about the oath-brothers Thorgeir and Thormod, inspired by the old Icelandic sagas <i>Saga of the Sworn Brothers </i>and <i>Saga of Saint Olaf</i>. The brothers fight for glory, raid for treasure, and seduce women against the backdrop of a new cult of Christianity. But where the old sagas depict their heroes as glorious champions, Laxness does the opposite.

New forms of religious life provided the impetus for a new mysticism whose influence continues today. This book documents the spirited dialogue between men and women that made possible the richness of mysticism in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p><p>Bernard McGinn is the Naomi Shenstone Donnelley Professor Emeritus in the Divinity School of the University of Chicago. He is the author of Anti-Christ, Early Christian Mystics, The Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism, and The Mystical Thought of Meister Eckhart. He lives in Chicago.(from the author's preface) <p>When I first conceived the possibility of writing this history of Christian mysticism, I was already convinced from my previous reading and teaching that the year 1200 marked a major turning point in the mysticism of Western Christianity. New styles of religious life, especially the mendicants and the beguines, new forms of mystical expression, as well as the sudden emergence of a more powerful role for women, all pointed to an important shift. My original plan was to devote a volume to the development of mysticism before 1200, a story largely revolving around the contribution of monastics to the foundation and growth of mysticism as a distinct element in Christianity. The second volume was to treat the period between 1200 and roughly 1600, the rich centuries of the flowering of what I have come to call the "new mysticism" of the late medieval and early modern periods. The third volume was to deal with the crisis of mysticism in the seventeenth century, its marginal position in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and its revival in our own time. </p><p>Habent sua fata libelli-"Books have their destinies"; so does the writing of books. The richness of the search for deeper and even immediate experience of the presence of God by Christians between the third century and the end of the twelfth century made it impossible for me to do any real justice to the early history of mysticism in a single volume as I had planned. The writing eventually led to two substantial books: The Foundations of Mysticism (1991) and The Growth of Mysticism (1994). Given that modification, I was not surprised when it became clear to me that what was originally conceived of as the second volume of The Presence of God also needed to be split into at least two parts. </p><p>...In this volume... the reader will not find Meister Eckhart or his predecessors (among whom Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas must be numbered, at least in some respects). Nor will one find chapters devoted to his followers, such as Henry Suso and John Tauler among the Dominicans, and even the great John Ruusbroec, who, despite his independence of mind, was touched by Eckhart's thought. The important male mystics who lived and wrote between 1300 and 1350 will appear in the next volume, entitled Continuity and Change in Western Mysticism. The fourth volume will overlap chronologically with the present book in its first part, but extend well beyond it through the late medieval and early modern periods. </p><p>...The treatment of the women mystics of the later Middle Ages, both in this volume and that to follow, reflects a different perspective from that of many of their recent investigators and supporters. Without the contributions of contemporary feminist scholarship, the history of medieval thought would probably not have come to a deeper appreciation of most of these women, especially those whose stories have been all too easily dismissed as impossible and extreme. Even the women mystics who were authors themselves have left us writings that are often difficult to decipher by historians of theology more habituated to linear, scholastic modes of thinking. Despite the many ways in which I have profited from feminist scholarship on medieval women mystics, however, The Flowering of Mysticism is written not from a feminist perspective but from that of a historical theologian attempting to do justice to the full range of late medieval mysticism. From this perspective it does not seem fruitful, or even possible, to identify a single "women's mysticism" in the later Middle Ages. There are, to be sure, mystical themes and practices that were pioneered by women, and there are significant differences in how women used language to express their sense of the mystery of God. But rarely, if ever, do we find an aspect of the new mysticism that belongs to women alone. Even more significant is the amazing variety that characterized the women, again notwithstanding the many themes they shared in conveying their message about how to attain loving union with God. It seems far more important to celebrate the diversity of the contribution of women than to search for an elusive unity.</p></p><h2>Leonardo da Vinci and a Memory of His Childhood (Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud)</h2><p><p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci (1910) remains among the most fascinating, though speculative, works of Freud's entire output.</strong></p> A detailed reconstruction of Leonardo's emotional life from his earliest years, it represents Freud's first sustained venture into biography from a psychoanalytic perspective, and also his effort to trace one route that homosexual development can take.</p><p><p><strong>Sigmund Freud</strong> (1856-1939) is one of the twentieth century's greatest minds and the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychology.

Ellen Grafton perfectly captures the selfish, manipulative Heather and the disgusted responses of her stepsiblings. Their parents, hopeful that the family will come together with a move to the country, find a home next to a graveyard--a graveyard with a ghost who leads young girls into a watery grave. As Heather fights to pull the family apart and makes an alliance with the ghost, Grafton&#39;s reading hints at her inner struggle. The strength of Grafton&#39;s narration is the power she gives to the many strained family interactions. These create a listening tension that mounts to a taut conclusion as Molly fights to save the tormented Heather from the ghost.

Her earliest memories are marked by these numbers, but it takes her father's premature death for Maddie and her family to realize that these mysterious digits are actually deathdates, and just like birthdays, everyone has one.<br><br>Forced by her alcoholic mother to use her ability to make extra money, Maddie identifies the quickly approaching deathdate of one client's young son, but because her ability only allows her to see the <em>when</em> and not the <em>how</em>, she's unable to offer any more insight. When the boy goes missing on that exact date, law enforcement turns to Maddie.<br><br>Soon, Maddie is entangled in a homicide investigation, and more young people disappear and are later found murdered. A suspect for the investigation, a target for the murderer, and attracting the attentions of a mysterious young admirer who may be connected to it all, Maddie's whole existence is about to be turned upside down. Can she right things before it's too late?</p><p>Victoria Laurie is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling adult mystery author and a former professional psychic intuitive. Both careers have served her beautifully in crafting her young adult debut, <em>When</em>. She lives and writes in Michigan.Gr 9 Up Maddie has always seen the date people will die, but does not realize what she is seeing until one day, in first grade, her father is killed on a date she told him about two years prior. The tragedy sends Maddie's life spinning out of control: her mother can no longer function without alcohol, they leave the city to live in a small community, Maddie's ability makes it difficult to make friends, and her mother cannot hold down a job. They survive on her father's wrongful death settlement. Maddie, now 16, also makes ends meet by charging a small fee to tell people their death dates. A mother comes for a reading for her youngest son, but Maddie notices that the woman's older son will die in a week instead. The customer accuses Maddie of fraud. When the older boy goes missing a week later, the FBI show up at the protagonist's school because they suspect Maddie and her best friend, Stubby, of foul play. Soon, more children go missing and turn up dead. This fast-paced story is a little farfetched: the FBI arrest and badly beat Stubby, Maddie suffers unbelievable bullying from classmates and school administrators, all while her mother goes on drinking. At times, the teen seems younger than her years. The plot is filled with false turns, which will keep readers engaged until the surprising ending. Lisa Nabel, Dayton Metro Library, OH SLJ"<br><br>If you could know the date of your death, would you? For Maddie, there's no choice: For her whole life, she's had the ability to see the date of anyone's death, hovering just over the forehead. But her gift hasn't helped her much-it didn't prevent her police-officer father from being killed in the line of duty, and it hasn't stopped her grief-stricken mother from descending into alcoholism. Now, Maddie does her best to blend in, uses her ability to make some extra money for herself and her mother, and spends time with her best friend, Stubs. But then a client's son disappears and is later found dead on the date that Maddie predicted he would die. Suspicion falls squarely on Maddie, especially when another teenager is murdered in similar fashion-and Stubs becomes caught up in the investigation too. The tension inexorably mounts as Maddie faces heartbreaking choices. Readers will root for Maddie not only to find the killer, but to gain a little happiness, too. Laurie's debut for teens is quite an accomplishment: Maddie's voice rings true, and her character development is handled well. Some adult characters are less well-rounded, yet the compelling plot overcomes these flaws. The character development is just as riveting as the plot in this well-constructed thriller. (Paranormal thriller. 12-18) Kirkus"<br><br>4Q 5P J S When Maddie was four years old, she discovered that she could see something strange: numbers on foreheads. When she was six years old, she learned that those numbers were death dates. When Maddie is sixteen, her mother is struggling with alcohol addiction and Maddie performs readings for people. When a rich woman comes to her about her daughter, Maddie sees a photo of the woman's son with a date for next week. Maddie tries to tell the woman her daughter will be fine but that her son is in danger and will soon die. The woman leaves very angry. Maddie and best friend Stubby try calling the woman again, but she threatens them with police action. When the woman's son goes missing and is found gruesomely murdered, Maddie and Stubby are hauled in for questioning by the FBI. Maddie must do all she can to convince the FBI of her powers and help solve the crime before she becomes the next victim. This paranormal mystery quickly introduces characters' backgrounds and proceeds directly to solving the crime, with lots of intrigue and suspense. The intense description of tough social life in high school for the odd teen outsider is perfect and even shocking at times. The supportive friendship between Maddie and Stubby, and whether they or their friendship will survive, is engrossing. This excellent book is a must-have for all libraries, especially where suspense and teen-life fiction is hot. This novel will provide crossover appeal to both older teens and adults.-Karen Sykeny. VOYA"<br><br>Sixteen-year-old Maddie Fynn usually keeps quiet about her gift for predicting the day a person will die, but a well-intentioned warning to a woman about her son's imminent death soon lands Maddie at the center of an FBI investigation when the child turns up viciously murdered. More death dates foretell the murder of local teens, but Maddie's efforts to save them quickly make her a suspect and the center of a community witch-hunt. Maddie finds a reluctant ally in an open-minded agent, but as they piece together clues to the killer's identity they find that Maddie may be at the center of the case after all. Established adult mystery writer Laurie sticks to her strengths here, creating a taut, well-plotted thriller with a dash of the paranormal. The strong build-up, including a few twists, keeps the story moving, while the surprising resolution and final showdown will have readers on the edge of their seats. Though the storytelling is the main draw, Maddie adds her own charm as a determined young woman with too many responsibilities, both familiarly familial and uniquely supernatural. Descriptions of the murders are only mildly gory, so readers wary of horror can get their thrills without the blood and guts, and the novel packs in plenty of fast-paced, nail-biting fun, perfect for fans of Barnes' The Naturals series (The Naturals, BCCB 12/13, etc.) or Winnacker's Imposter (BCCB 10/13). AM BCCB"<br><br>Maddie and Stubbs have to deal with classmates who see Maddie as a witch and Stubbs as a little different. Maddie reads death dates to make extra money. When there are two deaths in town, Maddie and Stubbs are involved. School is no longer a safe place for Maddie as she is bullied by students and teachers alike. When Stubbs is arrested, Maddie proves to an FBI agent that she can see dates, and in the process she helps him save his partner. Maddie is portrayed as a strong character; she is resilient and hopeful about the future. Readers will ponder the question of whether they would want to know when their time was up, or if they could be the one to tell others. Laurie does a masterful job of leaving the reader in suspense throughout the entire book, wondering who the killer is and how they find their victims.

Featuring ten chapters by leading international experts, this volume presents an up-to-date and authoritative introduction to the history of Nazi Germany.<br> Opening with an introduction delineating the challenges this period of history has posed to historians since 1945, <em>Nazi Germany</em> continues on with chapters that explain how Nazism emerged as an ideology and a political movement; how Hitler and his party took power and remade the German state; and how the Nazi "national community" was organized around a radical and eventually lethal distinction between the "included" and the "excluded." Later chapters discuss the complex relationship between Nazism and Germany's religious faiths; the perverse economic rationality of the regime; the path to war laid down by Hitler's foreign policy; and the intricate and intimate intertwining of war and genocide.

Casey pursued a Spartan business philosophy that emphasized military discipline, drab uniforms, and reliability over flash&#x2015;a model that is still reflected in UPS culture today.</p> <p><i>Big Brown</i> examines all the seeming paradoxes about UPS: from its traditional management style and strict policies coupled with high employee loyalty and strong labor relations; from its historical &#x201c;anti-marketing&#x201d; bias (why brown?) to its sterling brand loyalty and reputation for quality.</p></p><p><p><b>The Author</b> </p><p><b>GREG NIEMANN,</b> a Southern California travel and outdoors writer, followed the classic UPS career for almost thirty-five years, rising from loader, to driver, to management. He was West Coast editor of the company's employee publications and was often a liaison for top management. While at UPS, Niemann was accredited by the International Association of Business Communicators and named IABC Communicator of the Year.</p>"UPS founder Jim Casey did more than overcome humble beginnings to achieve the American Dream&#x2015;he inspired all of his employees to come along for the ride. The continuous success of a company founded on a hundred dollars, determination, and integrity is a story of inspiration. Big Brown is a must-read for anyone who's ever held a job or had a dream."<br> &#x2015;Paul Casey, nephew of UPS founder Jim Casey <p>"UPS began life in Seattle a century ago. Greg Niemann captures that moment&#x2015;and the spirit of Seattle&#x2015;perfectly."<br> &#x2015;Mayor Greg Nickels, City of Seattle</p> <p>"Big Brown offers a rare insider's glimpse into a corporate culture cloaked in secrecy.

Also learn how they attempt to use this obsessive attention to detail to conquer their industry."<br> &#x2015;Steven J. Christensen, first vice president,Christensen Wealth Management Group, Wachovia Securities</p> <p>"This well-written, solidly researched history details how one man's vision and the inexorable march of events led to the evolution of a Seattle messenger service into a worldwide icon. In Big Brown, Niemann successfully delivers the goods&#x2015;just as UPS has been doing for 100 years."<br> &#x2015;Norm Leaper, former president,International Association of Business Communicators</p> <p>"As a career UPSer, I thought I knew almost everything about my company's history worth knowing . . . until I read Greg Niemann's book, Big Brown. Today's UPSers will not only appreciate the wealth of historical tidbits, as I did, but also gain a greater understanding about why the company holds to its own unique way of doing business.

Thompson, and Gay Talese launched the New Journalism movement, Robert S. Boynton sits down with nineteen practitioners of what he calls the <i>New </i>New Journalism to discuss their methods, writings and careers.<br><br> The New New Journalists are first and foremost brilliant reporters who immerse themselves completely in their subjects. Jon Krakauer accompanies a mountaineering expedition to Everest. Ted Conover works for nearly a year as a prison guard. Susan Orlean follows orchid fanciers to reveal an obsessive subculture few knew existed. Adrian Nicole LeBlanc spends nearly a decade reporting on a family in the South Bronx. And like their muckraking early twentieth-century precursors, they are drawn to the most pressing issues of the day: Alex Kotlowitz, Leon Dash, and William Finnegan to race and class; Ron Rosenbaum to the problem of evil; Michael Lewis to boom-and-bust economies; Richard Ben Cramer to the nitty gritty of politics. How do they do it? In these interviews, they reveal the techniques and inspirations behind their acclaimed works, from their felt-tip pens, tape recorders, long car rides, and assumed identities; to their intimate understanding of the way a truly great story unfolds. <br><br> Interviews with: <br> Gay Talese<br> Jane Kramer<br> Calvin Trillin<br> Richard Ben Cramer<br> Ted Conover<br> Alex Kotlowitz<br> Richard Preston<br> William Langewiesche<br> Eric Schlosser<br> Leon Dash<br> William Finnegan<br> Jonathan Harr<br> Jon Krakauer<br> Adrian Nicole LeBlanc<br> Michael Lewis<br> Susan Orlean<br> Ron Rosenbaum<br> Lawrence Weschler<br> Lawrence Wright</p><p>Robert S. Boynton is the director of&nbsp;the Literary Reportage program at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University. He graduated with honors in philosophy and religion from Haverford College, and received an MA in political science from Yale University.&nbsp;He has been a senior editor at <i>Harper's</i> and a contributing writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>. His work has appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times Magazine, The Nation, Rolling Stone</i> and many other publications.Ted Conover <br><br>The first time Ted Conover was asked if he was a tramp he wasn&#x2019;t sure how to respond. The son of a successful lawyer, Conover had been jumping on and off trains for months, riding the rails as research for his college anthropology thesis. He certainly <i>looked</i> the part; even his parents didn&#x2019;t recognize him when he showed up on their doorstep. In fact, he had entered the life so completely that when another tramp tried to jump into his boxcar (a violation of hobo etiquette), Conover barely hesitated before stepping on the man&#x2019;s hand, sending him flying off the moving train. &#x201c;I guess I am,&#x201d; he answered uneasily, all too aware of the vast expanse&#x2014;economic, social, intellectual&#x2014;separating him from his veteran-tramp interlocutor. <br><br>It is this expanse that Conover has spent the last two decades exploring, first in <b>Rolling Nowhere</b> (1984), the cult classic he wrote about his hobo travels, and then in his three subsequent books&#x2014;<b>Coyotes</b> (1987), <b>Whiteout</b> (1991), and <b>Newjack</b> (2000)&#x2014;about Mexican illegal aliens, Aspen celebrities, and prison guards. Together, they have cemented Conover&#x2019;s reputation as one of the finest participatory journalists of his generation. <br><br>Those who have read only one or two of Conover&#x2019;s works might cubbyhole him as the bard of gritty, rough-and-tumble subcultures. While not untrue, the description is incomplete. It obscures Conover&#x2019;s real subject: the fine lines separating &#x201c;us&#x201d; from &#x201c;them,&#x201d; and the elaborate rituals and markers&#x2014;&#x201c;parts of town, railroad tracks and boulevards, places in the heart and mind,&#x201d; he writes in <b>Coyotes</b>&#x2014;that we have developed to bolster such distinctions. <br><br>In Conover&#x2019;s hands, migrant workers, rootless hoboes, and prison guards become vivid, morally ambiguous characters, deserving of praise <i>and</i> scorn, admiration <i>and</i> pity. Without sacrificing the commitment of the early-twentieth-century muckrakers, or the gusto of the nineteenth-century literary adventurers in whose footsteps he walks, Conover combines &#x201c;a sociologist&#x2019;s eye for detail with a novelist&#x2019;s sense of drama and compassion,&#x201d; as <i>The New York Times</i>&#x2019;s Michiko Kakutani wrote of <b>Coyotes</b>. <br><br>Born in 1958 in Okinawa, Japan, where his father was stationed as a navy pilot, Conover was raised in an affluent Denver neighborhood. In high school, he was bused to a newly desegregated school (50 percent black, 40 percent white, and 10 percent Hispanic), and he credits the experience with inspiring his love of anthropology (a discipline he calls &#x201c;philosophy as lived by real people&#x201d;). &#x201c;I learned that one&#x2019;s own culture is not necessarily normative,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;that there are many ways of looking at the world.&#x201d; <br><br>In 1980, after three years of studying anthropology at Amherst, Conover wearied of the college&#x2019;s elitism. Conover proposed to ride the rails for his senior thesis. He wanted to learn whether hoboes were great American rebels (&#x201c;renegades, conscientious objectors to the nine-to-five work world&#x201d;), infantrymen in the army of homeless who were then inundating cities across America, or both. The college said they couldn&#x2019;t sanction an illegal activity, but Conover completed the fieldwork on his own time, hitting the road armed with little more than an emergency stash of traveler&#x2019;s checks. <br><br>Conover returned to Amherst to write his senior thesis gaining approval for the project after the fact, when his professor saw the notes he&#x2019;d taken on the trip. He also spun off an autobiographical article for a student magazine, which caught the attention of several television producers. His enthusiasm for the subject bolstered by the attention, Conover turned down the reporting job he had been offered at <i>The Indianapolis Star</i> and decided to write a book about his adventures. <br><br><b>Rolling Nowhere</b> was published in 1984. <i>Washington Post</i> staff writer Chip Brown noted the peculiarly American themes&#x2014;expansion, restlessness, the myth of the West&#x2014;that would mark much of Conover&#x2019;s future work. &#x201c;Freight trains possess grandeur. They cast an epic spell. With their long whistles and their magical names, they summarize something in us, for they have carried not just the steel and wheat of America, but the nation&#x2019;s westwardness and some measure of its spacious dream,&#x201d; Brown wrote. <br><br>After graduating from Amherst summa cum laude, he won a spot as a Marshall Scholar at Cambridge University. It was not long before Conover was back on the road, expanding on the insight he had gained writing <b>Rolling Nowhere</b>: &#x201c;Mexican farmworkers were the new American hoboes.&#x201d; For <b>Coyotes</b>, Conover crossed the U.S.-Mexican border four times, traveling with migrant workers through California, Arizona, Idaho, and Florida. He picked lemons and oranges, and lived for a time in the village of Ahuacatlan, Quer�taro, the hometown of a number of the illegal immigrants he met. <br><br>Again, some critics realized that Conover was writing about something more fundamental than the immigration debate. &#x201c;What makes it really glow on every page is Mr. Conover&#x2019;s realization that he is dealing neither with a crime nor a tragedy, but with another of those human adventures that make America a country that is constantly renewing itself,&#x201d; wrote T. D. Allman in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. <br><br>Back in New York, Conover was rankled at a cocktail party when a friend introduced him as &#x201c;Ted Conover, a writer who makes his living sleeping on the ground.&#x201d; The accuracy of the remark disturbed him. &#x201c;I was unsettled to feel so easily typecast at age thirty, and began to wonder whether my participant-observer method could be used to write about people who weren&#x2019;t remote or poor.&#x201d; <br><br>The result was his 1991 book, <b>Whiteout: Lost in Aspen</b>, in which Conover conducted what he described as &#x201c;an ethnography of hedonism,&#x201d; observing Aspen&#x2019;s celebrity culture from his perches as a local cab driver and reporter at the <i>Aspen Times</i>. As with his previous books, <b>Whiteout</b> was a meditation on the author&#x2019;s ambiguous relationship to the phenomenon he chronicled&#x2014;the &#x201c;great celebrity laboratory&#x201d; that Aspen had become. Some critics were disappointed by Conover&#x2019;s turn away from the dispossessed. Writing in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Richard Eder felt that Conover&#x2019;s considerable &#x201c;talent overmatches his subject.&#x201d; Others perceived a continuity. &#x201c;His subject is Aspen, the glittering ski resort and celebrity enclave in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The underlying theme, however, is similar to that explored in his earlier books: the promise and betrayal of the American Dream,&#x201d; wrote Kakutani. <br><br>In the early nineties, Conover asked the New York State Depart-ment of Correctional Services for permission to write an article for <i>The New Yorker</i> in which he would follow a guard through training. The U.S. prison population was at an all-time high, and he conceived of the story as being as much about economics as society. The Department is New York State&#x2019;s second-largest employer, and ailing communities throughout the region routinely bid for new prisons in the hopes they will revive the local economy. <br><br>When his formal request was rejected, Conover applied for a job as a guard, carefully navigating the ethical and legal minefield of undercover reporting. He offered no false information on his application, but did omit mention of his three books, and he vowed to himself not to write anything about the experience until after he had quit. &#x201c;When I was a guard, I wanted to be 100 percent a guard,&#x201d; he says, living on a guard&#x2019;s salary and eschewing writing assignments. Fortunately, journalists and guards do share one thing&#x2014;both carrying around notebooks in which to jot down their observations. Every night, from March 1997 to January 1998, when he returned from Sing Sing, Conover would type up pages of single-spaced notes (nearly five hundred in all), elaborating on the day&#x2019;s observations. It was part journalism and part therapy, as he tried to unburden himself of the awful things he&#x2019;d witnessed&#x2014;and taken part in&#x2014;every day. <br><br>The project required complete secrecy, and Conover&#x2019;s double life took a toll. He was wracked with terrible headaches and found he was often sullen around his family. He feared he was allowing the anarchy of Sing Sing to seep into his placid home life. Published in 2000, <b>Newjack</b> won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Conover was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2003 and is at work on a book about roads. In February 2004, Conover received the kind of compliment life pays to art. Using <b>Newjack</b> as their guide, a group of Sing Sing inmates hatched an ingenious (though unsuccessful) escape plan in which they would pose as guards.<br><b>Do you think of yourself as a &#x201c;New Journalist&#x201d;? <br></b>It isn&#x2019;t a phrase I use, although I wouldn&#x2019;t object if someone called me that. Wolfe&#x2019;s essay on the New Journalism was important to me because it articulated and validated many of the methods&#x2014;saturation reporting, attention to detail, attention to status, etc.&#x2014;I was already practicing. I feel lucky to have started my writing career at a time when writers like Wolfe were experimenting with the tools of the fiction writer. <br><br><b>So if not &#x201c;New Journalism,&#x201d; what do you call your genre of journalism? <br></b>I write nonfiction narratives. I like that phrase because it doesn&#x2019;t have the pretensions of &#x201c;literary journalism,&#x201d; and it stresses the fact that storytelling is the backbone of my work. <br><br><b>What subjects are you drawn to? <br></b>I guess mainly those that seem socially significant and underreported, particularly if they allow me to participate in the story in some meaningful way. I might discover a situation or group&#x2014;sometimes a marginal or strange subculture&#x2014;which I find fascinating. By participating in that world, I try to offer the reader a level of insight and detail he would not otherwise have. I prefer smaller, overlooked stories. I&#x2019;d rather not be competing with the presidential press corps. I like to take my time and to be a bit contrarian. <br><br><b>Why subcultures? <br></b>In college I studied anthropology, which dovetails with journalism in fascinating and productive ways. If you&#x2019;re a journalist who has the luxury of time and a willingness to get your hands a little dirty, you will be able to get stories that nobody else gets. <br><br>An example is the story I told in <b>Newjack</b>. Here is an important subject, a worsening problem&#x2014;incarceration, the boom in building new prisons&#x2014;whose significance, I felt, was underappreciated by society at large. I found an unexplored angle from which to approach: guards are a stigmatized, insular subculture which have, for all their notoriety, rarely been written about. And guarding&#x2014;working as a correctional officer&#x2014;turned out to be something I could <i>do</i>. <br><br><b>So why not just interview prison guards? <br></b>Because I would only get part of the story. The interview will only take you so far, especially when you are talking to people who are uncomfortable with the press or who have things to hide. You can get further by conducting many interviews, over time, in different places. That was my original plan when I got the assignment from <i>The New Yorker</i>: I would follow a family of corrections officers at work and at home. But the New York State Department of Correctional Services turned down my requests for access to the prisons. And I thought, &#x201c;Until you&#x2019;ve seen somebody doing this kind of work, you probably won&#x2019;t know a thing about it.&#x201d; <br><br>I suppose what I&#x2019;m getting at is like the distinction between <i>tourist</i> and a <i>traveler</i>. The tourist experience is superficial and glancing. The traveler develops a deeper connection with her surroundings. She is more invested in them-the traveler stays longer, makes her own plans, chooses her own destination, and usually travels alone: solo travel and solo participation, although the most difficult emotionally, seem the most likely to produce a good story. <br><br><b>Do many of your stories begin as an opportunity for role-playing, whether you are writing about hoboes, illegal immigrants, or prison guards? <br></b>I guess there&#x2019;s some role-playing involved. I&#x2019;m fascinated by the idea of wearing different hats, of how one&#x2019;s outlook changes depending on one&#x2019;s position in the world, by the whole question of <i>identity</i>. For my first book, <b>Rolling Nowhere</b>&#x2014;which started as a college thesis&#x2014;I lived for four months as a hobo, with hoboes. The prospect was total wish fulfillment for me&#x2014;several freight lines run through my hometown of Denver, and I grew up with a bit of an image of the hobo as a cultural hero, the kind of romantic figure you find in Kerouac. Riding the rails seemed, on the one hand, a great adventure. <br><br>But I knew it was something else, too. This was 1980, when the word &#x201c;homeless&#x201d; was just entering our vocabulary because of the large number of street people appearing in cities. I wondered to myself, Were the transients on freight trains homeless people? Or were they&#x2014;as <i>they</i> insisted&#x2014;something else entirely? Were they a social problem, or&#x2014;the more romantic option&#x2014;conscientious objectors to the nine-to-five world? I liked the dialectic. So the project was two things, as I guess all my books have been: an intellectual inquiry, and an adventure. <br><br><b>Why did you study anthropology in college? <br></b>I&#x2019;d always been interested in philosophy, and anthropology seemed like philosophy as lived by real people. It was the study of how different groups of people view their experience of the world. Anthropology combines the abstractions of philosophy with the concreteness of lived experience. <br><br><b>What about the notion of multiple views and experiences of the world interested you?</b> <br>I think it started a long time ago. One big piece comes from high school in Denver, where I was bused by court order from a predominately white school to a predominately black school. I was a racial minority for the first time in my life and it taught me a lot. The world looks different when your own group is not in charge. Also, there was a core of progressive teachers who were determined to defy the larger community&#x2019;s expectations that there would be a riot and that the experiment in integration would fail. The students embraced the possibility that it could be a new kind of school, one without the archetypes of jocks, freaks, and nerds. It was a place where you could be something new: a white person cheering the basketball team, or a black person cheering the soccer team. I found it profoundly liberating. <br><br><b>How do you connect those lessons to the kind of journalism you practice? <br></b>One result was that it made me want to avoid the kind of journalism that relies heavily on &#x201c;credentialed&#x201d; sources. I sometimes think of what I do as a kind of a guerrilla action. I try to find people and groups who have <i>not</i> been heard from. I depend on the <i>newness</i> of this information to keep my audience interested in my writing.</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Salman Rushdie (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>Salman Rushdie is a major contemporary writer, who engages with some of the vital issues of our times: migrancy, postcolonialism, religious authoritarianism.

By exploring both the public actions and private papers of key figures such as Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, and Alexander Hamilton, Freeman reveals an alien and profoundly unstable political world grounded on the code of honor. In the absence of a party system and with few examples to guide America&#x2019;s experiment in republican governance, the rituals and rhetoric of honor provided ground rules for political combat. Gossip, print warfare, and dueling were tools used to jostle for status and form alliances in an otherwise unstructured political realm. These political weapons were all deployed in the tumultuous presidential election of 1800&#x2015;an event that nearly toppled the new republic.<br><br>By illuminating this culture of honor, Freeman offers new understandings of some of the most perplexing events of early American history, including the notorious duel between Burr and Hamilton. A major reconsideration of early American politics, <i>Affairs of Honor </i>offers a profoundly human look at the anxieties and political realities of leaders struggling to define themselves and their role in the new nation.</p><p>The more things change, the more they remain the same. Modern American politics may often resemble a demented circus, but thus it has always been. So writes historian Joanne Freeman in this vigorous account of America's first national leaders, those entrusted with creating a nation unlike any other on Earth, one "egalitarian, democratic, representative, straightforward, and virtuous in spirit, public-minded in practice." The reality was less noble than all that; as Freeman writes, the first postrevolutionary Congress, convened in the spring of 1789, was marked by regional and private rivalries, mudslinging, acrimony, favor-seeking, and backroom bargaining, all of which produced far more discord than unity. In that climate, as John Adams and George Washington would often complain, these early politicians were more interested in "their interests, careers, reputations, and pocketbooks" than in matters of the public good. Yet, Freeman suggests, it could scarcely have been otherwise; an "emotional logic" governed the governors, involving a shared code of honor that drew no lines between the personal with the political, so that any disagreement over policy was liable to turn into a duel or campaign of slander; a day-to-day style of conduct in which panic, paranoia, and shrill accusations were the norm; a fortress mentality in which anyone who was not a sworn friend was a sworn enemy.<p> Amazingly, it sometimes seems, they made a nation. Freeman's well-crafted study makes a useful corrective to the view that contemporary politics represents a freefall from some golden age, and it adds much to our understanding of America's past. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Admirable and entertaining." -Bill Kauffman, Wall Street Journal <p>"The book [provides] a read nearly as lively and idiosyncratic as the Founding Fathers themselves." -Scott Bernard Nelson, Boston Globe </p><p>"A landmark book." -Pauline Maier, Washington Post Book World </p><p>"The book's virtues are mighty ones.

It maps the huge and complex landscape of cell and molecular biology from the distinct perspective of physical biology. As a key organizing principle, the proximity of topics is based on the physical concepts that unite a given set of biological phenomena. Herein lies the central premise: that the appropriate application of a few fundamental physical models can serve as the foundation of whole bodies of quantitative biological intuition, useful across a wide range of biological problems. The Second Edition features full-color illustrations throughout, two new chapters, a significantly expanded set of end-of-chapter problems, and is available in a variety of e-book formats.</p><p><p><strong>Rob Phillips</strong> is the Fred and Nancy Morris Professor of Biophysics and Biology at the California Institute of Technology.

Using sound ecological principles, the author describes how these ecosystems are stabilized and directed toward realistic management objectives using natural recovery processes rather than expensive subsidies. An initial emphasis on repairing water and nutrient cycles, and increasing energy capture, will initiate and direct positive feedback repair systems that drive continuing autogenic recovery. This strategy is most appropriate where landuse goals call for low-input, sustainable vegetation managed for biological diversity, livestock production, timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed management, or ecosystem services. No other book provides such a comprehensive strategy for the ecological restoration of any wildland ecosystem, making this an invaluable resource for professionals working in the fields of ecological restoration, conservation biology and rangeland management.</p><p>The unique approach to ecological restoration described in this book will appeal to anyone interested in improving the ecological conditions, biological diversity, or productivity of damaged wildlands.

This innovative textbook takes this &#x201c;modern&#x201d; approach, teaching macroeconomics through its microeconomic foundations. It does so by adopting the <i>representative agent paradigm</i>. By modeling the <i>representative consumer</i> and the <i>representative firm,</i> students will learn to describe macroeconomic outcomes and consider the effects of macroeconomic policies. Unique in its coverage of monopolistic competition, financial markets, and the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy, <i>Modern Macroeconomics </i>is suitable for use in intermediate undergraduate, advanced undergraduate, and graduate level courses.</p><p>The book first introduces the building blocks of macroeconomics, the heart of which is the representative consumer. It goes on to offer a brief history of macroeconomic thought, including supply-side economics, the Phillips curve, and the New Keynesian framework. It then covers two policy applications, monetary policy and the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy; optimal policy analysis for both the flexible price and the rigid price case; long-run steady states, treating the Solow growth framework and the neoclassical growth model; a search-and-matching framework for the analysis of unemployment; and the application of the tools of modern macroeconomics to &#x201c;open economy,&#x201d; or international macroeconomics.

Born in the middle of the eighteenth century as a subject of King George II, the Father of the United States Constitution lived until 1836, when he died a citizen of Andrew Jackson&#39;s republic. For over forty years he played a pivotal role in the creation and defense of a new political order. He lived long enough to see even that Revolutionary world transformed, and the system of government he had nurtured threatened by the disruptive forces of a new era that would ultimately lead to civil war. In recounting the experience of Madison and several of his legatees who witnessed the violent test of whether his republic could endure, McCoy dramatizes the actual working out in human lives of critical cultural and political issues.</p><p>In recounting the experience of Madison and several of his legatees who witnessed the violent test of whether his republic could endure, this study dramatizes the human side of critical cultural and political issues.&#39;What makes this thoroughly researched study all the more enjoyable is McCoy&#39;s accomplishment as a biographer.

Through the voices of his informants, Andersson explores, viscerally and emphatically, how Europe&#x2019;s increasingly powerful border regime meets and interacts with its target&#x2013;the clandestine migrant. This vivid, rich work examines the subterranean migration flow from Africa to Europe, and shifts the focus from the &#x201c;illegal immigrants&#x201d; themselves to the vast industry built around their movements. This fascinating and accessible book is a must-read for anyone interested in the politics of international migration and the changing texture of global culture.</p><p>"<i>Illegality, Inc.</i> is a rollercoaster ride through the emerging Euro-African borderlands, and at the same time a clever, timely and sometimes disturbing look at the actors who inhabit these borderlands. I know of no other monograph that explores the phenomenon of international migration from inside the heavily funded European border police forces, while at the same time casting such a critical and sarcastic view on journalists, academics and well-meaning NGOs that make up a growing 'illegality industry' with far-reaching consequences for people on the move.

Extending across the vast expanses of the Sahara desert and the perilous journeys of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, from Senegal and Mali to the Warsaw headquarters of the EU&#x2019;s border police, Ruben Andersson deftly escorts his readers on a remarkable journey. Andersson&#x2019;s methodologically innovative ethnography is truly refreshing and inspiring. Engaging creatively with a bewilderingly diverse range of actors, sites, and settings, this study helps us to comprehend a complex constellation of the often absurd features of the European border regime and the multifarious subjects and projects constituted thereby. This book reveals numerous intriguing linkages across space and time in its exploration of the intricate workings of &#x201c;the illegality industry.&#x201d; Illegality, Inc. is a very rewarding work of scholarship and intellectual creativity, as well as a rare literary achievement."&#x2015;Nicholas De Genova, co-editor of <i>The Deportation Regime: Sovereignty, Space, and the Freedom of Movement</i><br><br> "This beautifully written and politically powerful book is as compelling and moving as a novel but has the intent and theoretical depth of serious scholarship. A must read for anyone interested in migration and the borders that are constructed to restrain it, Illegality Inc focuses our attention not so much on the African migrants who attempt to reach Southern Europe but on the ways in which &#x2018;illegality&#x2019; is both discursively and practically brought into being and the industry of prevention, control and humanitarianism that has grown up around it."&#x2015;Katy Gardner, Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science<br> &nbsp;<b>Ruben Andersson</b> is Associate Professor at the Department of International Development at the University of Oxford.

Ken Macrorie touches on the answer in his preface: "Good teaching in any field isn't a matter of employing gimmicks and choosing from a damnfool encyclopedia of tricks to play on students . . . but a matter of setting up a climate friendly to learning and then challenging learners to connect their experience and ideas with those of the accepted authorities or producers. Students can't become truly educated unless they grow out of and beyond themselves . . . <i>Telling Writing</i> gives them an indispensable base, a knowledge of themselves on which to grow." </p> <p>Macrorie's approach works because it helps students break away from the deadly academic prose fostered by so many writing courses and enables them to write about and from their own experiences. </p></p><p><p>Ken Macrorie has served as editor of College Composition and Communication, has taught at Michigan State, San Francisco State, and Western Michigan universities, and for thirteen summers was an instructor at the Bread Loaf School of English.

Ken's association with Heinemann-Boynton/Cook began more than a quarter century ago with the publication of Telling Writing, in which he asserted, "Good teaching in any field isn't a matter of employing gimmicks and choosing from a damnfool encyclopedia of tricks to play on students . . . but a matter of setting up a climate friendly to learning and then challenging learners to connect their experience and ideas with those of the accepted authorities or producers." Through this and his other ground-breaking books, Uptaught, Writing to Be Read, and The I-Search Paper, Ken touched and changed the lives of countless thousands of students-and their teachers-by revealing to them their own latent abilities to write their stories, tell their truths, find their interests, research their curiosities, and finally organize what they need and want to say into memorable prose. Ken's deep respect for students and intolerance of educationally unsound "quick fixes" continue to inform our publishing program just as they did when his books helped first launch us as a publisher. We will be forever grateful to Ken and the significant role he played in Heinemann-Boynton/Cook's publishing history.

The experiences of the novel's young hero, Stephen Dedalus, unfold in astonishingly vivid scenes that seem freshly recalled from life and provide a powerful portrait of the coming of age of a young man of unusual intelligence, sensitivity, and character.<br>The interest of the novel is deepened by Joyce's telling portrayals of an Irish upbringing and schooling, the Catholic Church and its priesthood, Parnell and Irish politics, encounters with the conflicting roles of art and morality (problems that would follow Joyce throughout his life), sexual experimentation and its aftermath, and the decision to leave Ireland.<br>Rich in details that offer vital insights into Joyce's art, this masterpiece of semiautobiographical fiction remains essential reading in any program of study in modern literature.</p></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesPerhaps Joyce&#39;s most personal work, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man depicts the intellectual awakening of one of literature&#39;s most memorable young heroes, Stephen Dedalus. Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen&#39;s youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce&#39;s highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce&#39;s book would &#34;remain a permanent part of English literature,&#34; while H.G. Wells dubbed it &#34;by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.&#34; A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce&#39;s reputation as one of the world&#39;s greatest and lasting writers.</p><h2>The European Witch-Hunt</h2><p><p><em>The European Witch-Hunt </em>seeks to explain why thousands of people, mostly lower-class women, were deliberately tortured and killed in the name of religion and morality during three centuries of intermittent witch-hunting throughout Europe and North America. </p> <p>Combining perspectives from history, sociology, psychology and other disciplines, this book provides a comprehensive account of witch-hunting in early modern Europe. Julian Goodare sets out an original interpretation of witch-hunting as an episode of ideologically-driven persecution by the &#x2018;godly state&#x2019; in the era of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. Full weight is also given to the context of village social relationships, and there is a detailed analysis of gender issues. Witch-hunting was a legal operation, and the courts&#x2019; rationale for interrogation under torture is explained. Panicking local elites, rather than central governments, were at the forefront of witch-hunting. Further chapters explore folk beliefs about legendary witches, and intellectuals&#x2019; beliefs about a secret conspiracy of witches in league with the Devil. Witch-hunting eventually declined when the ideological pressure to combat the Devil&#x2019;s allies slackened. A final chapter sets witch-hunting in the context of other episodes of modern persecution. </p> <p>This book is the ideal resource for students exploring the history of witch-hunting. Its level of detail and use of social theory also make it important for scholars and researchers. </p></p><p><p><strong>Julian Goodare</strong> is Reader in History at the University of Edinburgh. His previous books include <i>The Government of Scotland, 1560&#x2013;1625</i> (2004), and (as editor) <i>Scottish Witches and Witch-Hunters</i> (2013). He is Director of the online Survey of Scottish Witchcraft.</p><p>"This is a wonderful work, with real pace, clarity and sparkle which combines excellent scholarship with a full recognition of the emotive quality of the material. It will exactly suit the intelligent, enquiring and thoughtful among students and general readers, and be of real interest and value to scholars."<br><strong>Ronald E. Hutton</strong>, <em>University of Bristol, UK</em> </p> <p>"This book excellently presents the different layers of meaning of witchcraft and witch trials all over Europe. Julian Goodare combines a sublime understanding of the topic with a personal interpretation in writing about one of the greatest enigmas in history: What was a witch and why were witches persecuted by their neighbors as well as by the state? The book provides a most fruitful resource for students and scholars in presenting new research and new perspectives on the history of witchcraft."<br><strong>Rita Voltmer</strong>, <em>University of Trier, Germany</em></p> <p>"Julian Goodare's <em>The European Witch-Hunt </em>is a valuable addition to the study of early modern witchcraft and witch-hunting. Goodare devotes extra attention to explaining the mentalities, both illiterate and erudite, that converged to create the stereotype of the witch. His explanations of recurrent themes in ideas about witchcraft will be particularly helpful to students and prepares them for a better understanding of primary texts and more specialized secondary studies."<em> <br></em><strong>Walter Stephens</strong><em>, John Hopkins University, USA</em></p> <p>&#x201c;In this illuminating book, Goodare (Univ. of Edinburgh, Scotland) explores the subjects of witches and witch-hunts in early modern Europe, 1400&#x2013;1750, maintaining that these years rather than the Middle Ages were the "witch years." He makes it clear that "although everyone feared witches, they did not all fear them in the same way" and offers readers a linked, fourfold concept of witchcraft to support this view ... An excellent bibliography, a map, charts, and a helpful appendix accompany the book, which complements studies by Brian Levack, The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (CH, Sep'87; 4th ed. 2016); Robin Briggs, Witches &amp; Neighbors (1996); and Lyndal Roper, Witch Craze (CH, Nov'05, 43-1819)."<br><strong>L.

Ancheta demonstrates how United States civil rights laws have been framed by a black-white model of race that typically ignores the experiences of other groups, including Asian Americans. When racial discourse is limited to antagonisms between black and white, Asian Americans often find themselves in a racial limbo, marginalized or unrecognized as full participants. <br><br>Ancheta examines legal and social theories of racial discrimination, ethnic differences in the Asian American population, nativism, citizenship, language, school desegregation, and affirmative action. In the revised edition of this influential book, Ancheta also covers post-9/11 anti-Asian sentiment and racial profiling. He analyzes recent legal cases involving political empowerment, language rights, human trafficking, immigrant rights, and affirmative action in higher education-many of which move the country farther away from the ideals of racial justice. On a more positive note, he reports on the progress Asian Americans have made in the corporate sector, politics, the military, entertainment, and academia. <br><br>A skillful mixture of legal theories, court cases, historical events, and personal insights, this revised edition brings fresh insights to U.S. civil rights from an Asian American perspective.<br></p><p>Angelo N.

The approach to drafting legal documents is highly structured to enable students to see how different parts fit together. Memos and briefs are divided into parts and organized into a required format. The format also provides students with a checklist to consult when constructing legal documents. <p><b>The Lawyer's Craft</b> recognizes that skills must be practiced to be learned. No matter how carefully students read the text and discuss it in class, they will not be able to learn the material until they actually put it to work. For this reason, <b>The Lawyer's Craft</b> includes numerous examples and exercises. The level of difficulty of the examples and exercises is gradually increased, allowing students to master the basics before moving on to nuances and exceptions.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Victor&#39;s Crown: A History of Ancient Sport from Homer to Byzantium</h2><p><em>The Victor's Crown</em> brings to vivid life the signal role of sport in the classical world. Ranging over a dozen centuries--from Archaic Greece through to the late Roman and early Byzantine empires--David Potter's lively narrative shows how sport, to the ancients, was not just a dim reflection of religion and politics but a potent social force in its own right. The passion for sport among the participants and fans of antiquity has been matched in history only by our own time.<br><br>Potter first charts the origins of competitive athletics in Greece during the eighth century BC and the emergence of the Olympics as a preeminent cultural event. He focuses especially on the experiences of spectators and athletes, especially in violent sports such as boxing and wrestling, and describes the physiology of conditioning, training techniques, and sport's role in education. Throughout, we meet the great athletes of the past and learn what made them great. The rise of the Roman Empire transformed the sporting world by popularizing new entertainments, particularly gladiatorial combat, a specialized form of chariot racing, and beast hunts. Here, too, Potter examines sport from the perspectives of both athlete and spectator, as he vividly describes competitions held in such famous arenas as the Roman Coliseum and the Circus Maximus. The Roman government promoted and organized sport as a central feature of the Empire, making it a sort of common cultural currency to the diverse inhabitants of its vast territory. <br><br>While linking ancient sport to events such as religious ceremonies and aristocratic displays, Potter emphasizes above all that it was the thrill of competition--to those who competed and those who watched--that ensured sport's central place in the Greco-Roman world.<br><br>"Vivid and authoritative. Potter skillfully reveals how the gymnasium lay at the heart of Greek life and culture, but his passion is clearly for the Olympics. When Potter moves on to Roman sport, things get livelier still. He meticulously traces the origins, careers and lifestyles of athletes, gladiators and charioteers alike, and demolished some cherished myths along the way. Most gladiatorial combats apparently ended in surrender, not death, although a crowd might well call out "<em>ingula!</em>" (kill!), running their thousands of thumbs under their throats in the original 'thumbs up' gesture.

Cast in the lively, literary form of a dialogue, this classic work presents a daring view of the orator as the master of all language communication while still emphasizing his role at the heart of Roman society and politics. Cicero's conception of the ideal orator represents his own original synthesis of the positions of the philosophers and the rhetoricians in the age-old quarrel between these disciplines. <br> The first translation of <em>De oratore</em> in over fifty years, this volume is ideal for courses on Cicero and on the history of rhetoric/oratory. James May and Jakob Wisse provide an accurate and accessible translation which is based on--and contributes to--recent advances in our understanding of <em>De</em> <em>oratore</em> and of the many aspects of ancient rhetoric, philosophy, and history relevant to it. Their translation reflects the many variations of Cicero's style, which are essential ingredients of the work. The volume includes extensive annotation, based on current scholarship and offering significant original contributions as well. It is also enhanced by a full introduction covering all important aspects of both the work and its historical background; appendices on Cicero's works, figures of thought and speech, and alternate manuscript readings; a glossary of terms from rhetoric and Roman life and politics; and a comprehensive index of names and places.<br></p><p>James M.

Harvey Mansfield reveals the role of sects in Machiavelli's politics, his advice on how to rule indirectly, and the ultimately partisan character of his project, and shows him to be the founder of such modern and diverse institutions as the impersonal state and the energetic executive. Accessible and elegant, this groundbreaking interpretation explains the puzzles and reveals the ambition of Machiavelli's thought.<br> <br> "The book brings together essays that have mapped [Mansfield's] paths of reflection over the past thirty years. . . . The ground, one would think, is ancient and familiar, but Mansfield manages to draw out some understandings, or recognitions, jarringly new."&#x2014;Hadley Arkes, <i>New Criterion</i><br> <br> "Mansfield's book more than rewards the close reading it demands."&#x2014;Colin Walters, <i>Washington Times</i><br> <br> "[A] masterly new book on the Renaissance courtier, statesman and political philosopher. . . . Mansfield seeks to rescue Machiavelli from liberalism's anodyne rehabilitation."&#x2014;Roger Kimball, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p></p><p>Machiavelli&#39;s Virtue is a comprehensive statement on the founder of modern politics. Harvey C. Mansfield begins by analyzing Machiavelli&#39;s radical notion of virtue, which culminates in his own personal virtue. Machiavelli shows that princes need a new morality that only he has supplied. Mansfield argues that Machiavelli intended to rule the world through his thought; though a prince without a state, his subjects were the princes who would follow his writings on founding and ruling. This new &#34;perpetual republic&#34; is Machiavelli&#39;s own sect - and a remedy for the failures of all previous republics. Mansfield reveals the role of sects in Machiavelli&#39;s politics, his advice on how to rule indirectly, and the ultimately partisan character of his project. Following the method of Leo Strauss, he takes up Machiavelli&#39;s individual works as wholes and shows him to be the founder of modern institutions that came later, such as the impersonal state and the energetic executive. Mansfield thus makes the case that Machiavelli is alive for us and full of the wisdom we need. His thought cannot be dismissed as quaint and obsolete; it is disturbingly relevant for our delusions and our complacency.Harvey C. Mansfield is the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government at Harvard University.</p><h2>Contemporary Topics 2 with Essential Online Resources (4th Edition)</h2><p><p>Now in a fourth edition, <b> <i>Contemporary Topics </i> </b>expands on its highly respected approach to developing academic listening and study skills.

What are these children like? What are their values, goals, and interests? What kinds of relationships do they have with their families? This is the first in-depth study to analyze what it is like to grow up as the state-appointed vanguard of modernization. Based on surveys and ethnographic research in China, where the author lived with teenage only children and observed their homes and classrooms for 27 months between 1997 and 2002, the book explores the social, economic, and psychological consequences of the government's decision to accelerate the fertility transition. <i>Only Hope</i> shows how the one-child policy has largely succeeded in its goals, but with unintended consequences. Only children are expected to be the primary providers of support and care for their retired parents, grandparents, and parents-in-law, and only a very lucrative position will allow them to provide for so many dependents. Many only children aspire to elite status even though few can attain it, and such aspirations lead to increased stress and competition, as well as intense parental involvement.</p><p>&#x201c;The first thing that makes Fong&#x2019;s book stand out from others is its timely presentation of the consequences of China&#x2019;s one-child policy, rather than being a discussion of the phenomenon in its early stage. Now that Chinese singletons are reaching adulthood, the consequences of the one-child policy have become a powerful social force driving Chinese society in an unprecedented direction. The second thing that makes Fong&#x2019;s book unique is its ethnographical research. Her in-depth personal experience enables her to observe and reveal the social reality of contemporary China. This vividly presented reality shows the outcome of the one-child policy interrelated and integrated with the political, educational, cultural, and economic systems of China.&#x201d;&#x2014;CHOICE<br>&#x201c;Vanessa L.

The discussion is designed for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate study, and presumes of readers only a fair knowledge of matrix algebra and of advanced calculus of functions of several real variables. <br>The author, who is a Professor of Mathematics at the Polytechnic Institute of New York, begins with a discussion of plane geometry and then treats the local theory of Lie groups and transformation groups, solid differential geometry, and Riemannian geometry, leading to a general theory of connections. <br>The author presents a full development of the Erlangen Program in the foundations of geometry as used by Elie Cartan as a basis of modern differential geometry; the book can serve as an introduction to the methods of E. Cartan. The theory is applied to give a complete development of affine differential geometry in two and three dimensions. <br>Although the text deals only with local problems (except for global problems that can be treated by methods of advanced calculus), the definitions have been formulated so as to be applicable to modern global differential geometry. The algebraic development of tensors is equally accessible to physicists and to pure mathematicians. The wealth of specific resutls and the replacement of most tensor calculations by linear algebra makes the book attractive to users of mathematics in other disciplines.</p><p></p><h2>Managing Conflict through Communication</h2><p><i> <b> <p> <i>Comprehensive and accessible coverage of the study of conflict </i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </b> </i> <p> </p> <p>Managing Conflict Through Communication helps students approach conflict constructively and learn more positive conflict management and resolution skills. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p>Narratives and case studies make the material accessible and engaging to a diverse student audience.

Fabio Rojas argues that sociologists use four different theoretical "moves" when they try to explain the social world: how groups defend their status, how people strategically pursue their goals, how values and institutions support each other, and how people create their social reality. Rojas uses famous sociological studies to illustrate these four types of theory and show how students and researchers may apply them to their interests. The guiding light of the book is the concept of the "social mechanism," which clearly and succinctly links causes and effects in social life.<br><br>Drawing on dozens of empirical studies that define modern sociology and focusing on the nuts and bolts of social explanation, Rojas reveals how areas of study within the field of sociology that at first glance seem dissimilar are, in fact, linked by shared theoretical underpinnings. In doing so, he elucidates classical and contemporary theory, and connects both to essential sociological findings made throughout the history of the field. Aimed at undergraduate students, graduate students, journalists, and interested general readers who want a more formal way to understand social life, <i>Theory for the Working Sociologist</i> presents the underlying themes of sociological thought using contemporary research and plain language.</p><p><i>Theory for the Working Sociologist</i> makes social theory easy to understand by revealing sociology's hidden playbook.

Topics span the discipline of public health and integrate materials, concepts, and frameworks from numerous fields in public health, such as health promotion, environmental health and health policy. By delving into both historical and contemporary cases, including international cases, the authors investigate the evolution and impact of various understandings of the concept of &#x201c;the public&#x201d; over time, i.e., the public not only as a numerical population that can be defined and measured, but also as a political group with legally defined obligations and relationships, as well as diverse cultural and moral understandings. <br><br>While the text examines a range of philosophical theories and contemporary perspectives, it is written in a way that presupposes no previous exposure to the philosophical concepts but at the same time provides challenging cases for students who do have more advanced knowledge. Thus the book should be useful in Schools and Programs in Public Health as well as for undergraduate public health courses in liberal arts institutions and for health sciences students at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels.</p><p>Director, Division of Public Health Policy &amp; Practice, School of Public Health, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia<br><br>Hollingsworth Professor of Ethics, Institute of Practical Ethics and Public Health, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia<br><br>Harrison Foundation Professor of Law and Medicine, University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia</p><h2>Showtime: A History of the Broadway Musical Theater</h2><p><p><strong>A definitive, accessible, and comprehensive history of the Broadway musical.</strong></p> Here for the first time is the whole history of the musical, on Broadway and off.

Rummel's fourth book in a series devoted to genocide and government mass murder, or what he calls democide. He presents the primary results, in tables and figures, as well as a historical sketch of the major cases of democide, those in which one million or more people were killed by a regime. In <em>Death by Government</em>, Rummel does not aim to describe democide itself, but to determine its nature and scope in order to test the theory that democracies are inherently nonviolent.</p><p>Rummel discusses genocide in China, Nazi Germany, Japan, Cambodia, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Pakistan. He also writes about areas of suspected genocide: North Korea, Mexico, and feudal Russia. His results clearly and decisively show that democracies commit less democide than other regimes. The underlying principle is that the less freedom people have, the greater the violence; the more freedom, the less the violence. Thus, as Rummel says, "The problem is power. The solution is democracy. The course of action is to foster freedom."</p><p><em>Death by Government</em> is a compelling look at the horrors that occur in modern societies. It depicts how democide has been very much a part of human history. Among other examples, the book includes the massacre of Europeans during the Thirty Years' War, the relatively unknown genocide of the French Revolution, and the slaughtering of American Indians by colonists in the New World. This riveting account is an essential tool for historians, political scientists, and scholars interested in the study of genocide.</p></p><p><p><em>R. J. Rummel </em>was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii. He is the author of over one hundred scholarly articles and two dozen books, including <em>Power Kills, China&#x2019;s Bloody Century, </em>and <em>The Miracle That Is Freedom. </em>&nbsp;In addition, he has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and been the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Conflict Processes Section of the American Political Science Association and the International Association of Genocide Scholars&#x2019; Award for Distinguished Lifetime Contribution to the Field of Genocide and Democide Studies and Prevention.</p><p>"["Death by Government"] should be read in history classes not just across America, but around the world.

E. B. DuBois prophesied that the colour line would be the key problem of the twentieth-century and he later identified one of its key dynamics: the new religion of whiteness that was sweeping the world. Whereas most historians have confined their studies of race-relations to a national framework, this book studies the transnational circulation of people and ideas, racial knowledge and technologies that under-pinned the construction of self-styled white men&#39;s countries from South Africa, to North America and Australasia. Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds show how in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century these countries worked in solidarity to exclude those they defined as not-white, actions that provoked a long international struggle for racial equality. Their findings make clear the centrality of struggles around mobility and sovereignty to modern formulations of both race and human rights.</p><p>This book studies the transnational circulation of people and ideas, racial knowledge and technologies that under-pinned the construction of white men&#39;s countries from South Africa, to North America and Australasia.

Dewey was an important early developer of the philosophy of&nbsp;pragmatism&nbsp;and one of the founders of&nbsp;functional psychology. He was a major representative of&nbsp;progressive education&nbsp;and&nbsp;liberalism.&nbsp;In 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded&nbsp;University of Chicago&nbsp;(1894&#x2013;1904) where he developed his belief in an empirically based theory of knowledge, becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled&nbsp;<em>Thought and its Subject-Matter</em>, which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title&nbsp;<em>Studies in Logical Theory</em>&nbsp;(1903). During that time Dewey also initiated the&nbsp;University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education,&nbsp;<em>The School and Social Progress</em>&nbsp;(1899).&nbsp;In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the&nbsp;American Psychological Association. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at both Columbia University&nbsp;and Columbia University's&nbsp;Teachers College.&nbsp;In 1905 he became president of the&nbsp;American Philosophical Association. He was a longtime member of the&nbsp;American Federation of Teachers.</p><h2>Evaluation Methodology Basics: The Nuts and Bolts of Sound Evaluation</h2><p><p><strong>Evaluation Methodology Basics: The Nuts and Bolts of Sound Evaluation</strong> provides a step-by-step guide for doing a real evaluation. It focuses on the main kinds of "big picture" questions that evaluators usually need to answer, and how the nature of such questions is linked to evaluation methodology choices. Jane Davidson explains how to combine a mix of qualitative and quantitative data with "relevant values" (such as needs) to draw explicitly evaluative conclusions.&nbsp;The book&nbsp;presents&nbsp;readers with useful rubrics and flowcharts that may be used during each stage of the evaluation. Many of the concepts presented in the chapters are illustrated with specific examples from a range of disciplines. </p></p><p><strong>Jane Davidson</strong> is former Associate Director of The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University, where she launched and directed the world&#x2019;s first fully interdisciplinary Ph.D. in evaluation.

Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.</p><p>Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. </p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.</p><p>You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles.

There, he begins a thrilling, whirlwind journey where dreams, memories and reality collide then diverge as Eiji is caught up in a feverish succession of encounters by turn bizarre, hilarious and shockingly dangerous. But until Eiji has fallen in love and exorcised his childhood demons, the belonging he craves will remain, tantalizingly, just beyond his grasp...</p><p>David Mitchell's second novel, <i>Number9Dream</i>, tells the story of Eiji Miyake, a young man negotiating a hypermodern and dangerous Tokyo to meet for the first time his secretive and powerful father. Na�ve and fresh from the Japanese countryside, Eiji encounters every obstacle imaginable in his quest, from his father's--and in-laws'--reluctance for the encounter to occur (Eiji is the bastard son) to fiery entanglements with <i>yakuza</i> (the Japanese mafia) to the overwhelming size and anonymity of Tokyo itself. <p> The novel is cartoonish in that Eiji has a vivid and violent imagination that fills the book with daydreams. When not chain-smoking, forlorn Eiji wanders the city following vague or cryptic leads that invariably dead-end or land him back among yakuza. Mitchell (author of the critically acclaimed <i>Ghostwritten</i>) has a smart, eclectic writing style that seems foreign, and the novel is well paced, but the yakuza encounters are too cinematic, complete with unusual torture and pyrotechnics. Moreover, in addition to Eiji's daydreams, the last half of the book contains excerpts from the diaries of his great uncle's World War II naval heroics and bizarre short stories that Eiji reads while hiding--the latter of which make for tedious reading. </p><p> <i>Number9Dream</i> is crafted from too many disparate components; it does not seem to be a full expression, but an overly crowded one. Readers will sympathize with Eiji and his search, but in the end will wonder what effect, if any, all the extraneous forces had on him. The book provides many fun moments, but ultimately it doesn't really add up to the sum of its parts. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><br>Praise for David Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Ghostwritten</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell . . . has a gift for fiction&#x2019;s natural pleasures&#x2014;intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mitchell is a fabulous ghostwriter fueled by a brilliant imagination and buoyed by beautifully descriptive writing. <i>Ghostwritten </i>is a brave new book for a brave new world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i><br><br>&#x201c;To complement its heady themes, G<i>hostwritten</i> is also elegantly composed, gracefully plotted, and full of humor. . . .

A follow-up to the previous <em>Ancient Christian Devotional,</em> which follows lectionary cycle A, this devotional guide follows lectionary cycle C, which begins in Advent 2009. This guide to prayer and reflection combines excerpts from the writings of the church fathers as found in the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture with a simple structure for daily or weekly reading and prayer. There are fifty-two weeks of readings following the weekly lectionary cycle C, which you can read through in order or by thematic interest. Each day you will also find a simple opening and closing prayer drawn from the prayers and hymns of the ancient church.

He was a land surveyor before leaving for England in 1959 to become a full-time writer. His exploration of the dense forests, rivers and vast savannahs of the Guyanese hinterland features prominently in the settings of his fiction. Harris&#39;s novels are complex, alluding to diverse mythologies from different cultures, and eschew conventional narration in favour of shifting interwoven voices. His first novel Palace of the Peacock (1960) became the first of The Guyana Quartet, which includes The Far Journey of Oudin (1961), The Whole Armour (1962) and The Secret Ladder (1963). He later wrote The Carnival Trilogy (Carnival (1985), The Infinite Rehearsal (1987) and The Four Banks of the River of Space (1990)). His most recent novels are Jonestown (1996), which tells of the mass-suicide of a thousand followers of cult leader Jim Jones; The Dark Jester (2001), his latest semi-autobiographical novel, The Mask of the Beggar (2003), and one of his most accessible novels in decades, The Ghost of Memory (2006). Wilson Harris also writes non-fiction and critical essays and has been awarded honorary doctorates by several universities, including the University of the West Indies (1984) and the University of Liege (2001). He has twice been winner of the Guyana Prize for Literature.</p><h2>A Woman's Work With Gurdjieff, Ramana Maharshi, Krishnamurti, Anandamayi Ma &amp; Pak Subuh</h2><p>The spiritual life story of Ethel Merston based on her diaries and recollections is an important historical work, as well as a keen insight into many of the seminal teachers of her times. Merston was one of Gurdjieff's first English pupils and lived at the Prieure from 1922 until 1927. Her seriousness and organizational abilities led Gurdjieff to put her in charge in his absences. Fritz Peters gives a wonderful account of what she had to put up with (he gives her the name Miss Madison) in his <i>Boyhood with Gurdjieff</i>. In India, she lived at Ramana Maharshi's ashram for many years. She gives a first-person account of his death and also the meeting between The Mother, Sri Aurobindo and Anandamayi Ma (with whom she often traveled). She also attended many of Krishnamurti's talks and seminars in the 1930s, was a friend of Sunyata, Alain Danielou, Krishna Prem and Swami Omananda. In the 1950s she was initiated into Subud by Pak Subuh at J. G. Bennett's Coombe Springs study house. At Mendham, she met again her friends from her Gurdjieff days - Mme de Salzmann, Mme Ouspensky, Olga de Hartmann and Peggy Flinsch - and was introduced to Lord John Pentland.</p><p>Mary Ellen Korman has long been interested in spiritual transformation and its many approaches. She teaches a yoga of body impressions and lives in southern Pennsylvania.Based on Ethel Merston's candid memoir, A Woman's Work chronicles her journey of self-transformation from privileged Victorian England to India. A resonant and engaging account of a spiritual seeker whose inner struggles, confusions and insights are recounted as she meets many of the key figures of her time. --<i>The Gurdjieff Journal</i><br><br>I found Ethel Merston's life story fascinating. The narrative completely absorbed me and I was captivated from the first sentence by both substance as well as style. Ethel Merston was an exceptional individual and it is wonderful that her story has finally been told. An important work with considerable research. --Ram Alexander, Editor, <i>Death Must Die: A Western Woman's Life-Long Spiritual Quest with Shree Anandamayee Ma</i><br><br>There are few comprehensive accounts of individual Western pioneers who were interested in Indian spirituality in the first part of the 20th century. Ethel Merston left an intimate record of her journey as she constantly questioned and searched for a remedy to relieve the malady of her soul. We owe to Mary Ellen Korman our appreciation for chronicling that time and bringing to life many of the people Ethel Merston encountered, and who we never quite knew as fellow seekers committed to the search for higher truths. --<i>The Mountain Path, The Journal of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi</i></p><h2>Murder Is Bad Manners (WELLS &amp; WONG MURDER IS B)</h2><p>Two friends form a detective agency&#x2014;and must solve their first murder case&#x2014;in this &#x201c;sharp-witted debut&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review) that is the first adventure in a brand-new middle grade mystery series set at a 1930s boarding school.<br><br>Daisy Wells and Hazel Wong are best friends at Deepdean School for Girls, and they both have a penchant for solving mysteries. In fact, outspoken Daisy is a self-described Sherlock Holmes, and she appoints wallflower Hazel as her own personal Watson when they form their own (secret!) detective agency. The only problem? They have nothing to investigate.<br> <br>But that changes once Hazel discovers the body of their science teacher, Miss Bell&#x2014;and the body subsequently disappears. She and Daisy are certain a murder must have taken place, and they can think of more than one person with a motive.<br> <br>Determined to get to the bottom of the crime&#x2014;and to prove that it happened&#x2014;before the killer strikes again, Hazel and Daisy must hunt for evidence, spy on their suspects, and use all the cunning, scheming, and intuition they can muster. But will they succeed? And can their friendship stand the test?<br> <br>Previously published as <i>Murder Most Unladylike</i> in the UK.</p><p>Robin Stevens was born in California and grew up in Oxford, England, across the road from the house where Alice of&nbsp;<i>Alice in Wonderland&nbsp;</i>lived. Robin has been making up stories all her life. She spent her teenage years at boarding school, reading a lot of murder mysteries and hoping that she&#x2019;d get the chance to do some detecting herself (she didn&#x2019;t). She studied crime fiction in college and then worked in children&#x2019;s publishing. Robin now lives in London with her pet bearded dragon, Watson.Murder Is Bad Manners <br><br> <br>This is the first murder that the Wells &amp; Wong Detective Society has ever investigated, so it is a good thing Daisy bought me a new casebook. The last one was finished after we solved The Case of Lavinia&#x2019;s Missing Tie. The solution to that, of course, was that Clementine stole it in revenge for Lavinia punching her in the stomach during lacrosse, which was Lavinia&#x2019;s revenge for Clementine telling everyone Lavinia came from a broken home. I suspect the solution to this new case may be more complex.<br> <br>I suppose I ought to give some explanation of ourselves, in honor of the new casebook. Daisy Wells is the president of the Detective Society, and I, Hazel Wong, am its secretary. Daisy says that this makes her Sherlock Holmes, and me Watson. This is probably fair. After all, I am much too short to be the heroine of this story, and who ever heard of a Chinese Sherlock Holmes?<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so funny that it was me who found Miss Bell&#x2019;s dead body. In fact, I think Daisy is still upset about it, though of course she pretends not to be. You see, Daisy is a heroine-like kind of person, and so it should be her that these things happen to.<br> <br>Look at Daisy and you think you know exactly the sort of person she is&#x2014;one of those dainty, absolutely English girls with blue eyes and golden hair; the kind who&#x2019;ll gallop across muddy fields in the rain clutching a hockey stick and then sit down and eat ten cinnamon rolls at tea. I, on the other hand, bulge all over like Bibendum the Michelin Man; my cheeks are moony-round and my hair and eyes are stubbornly dark brown.<br> <br>I arrived from Hong Kong partway through seventh grade, and even then, when we were all still shrimps (shrimps, for this new casebook, is what we call the little sixth- and seventh-grade girls), Daisy was already famous throughout Deepdean School. She rode horses, was part of the lacrosse team, and was a member of the Drama Club. The Big Girls, which is what we call the girls in the top grades, took notice of her, and by May the entire school knew that the head girl herself&#x2014;Deepdean&#x2019;s most important Big Girl&#x2014;had called Daisy a &#x201c;good sport.&#x201d;<br> <br>But that is only the outside of Daisy, the jolly-good-show part that everyone sees. The inside of her is not jolly-good-show at all.<br> <br>It took me quite a while to discover that.</p><h2>Rumi&#39;s World: The Life and Works of the Greatest Sufi Poet</h2><p>This book (previously published as <i>I Am Wind, You Are Fire </i>) celebrates the extraordinary career of Persia's great mystical poet, Rumi (1207&#x2013;1273), through the story of his life, along with an enlightening examination of his ecstatic verse. Rumi lived the quiet life of a religious teacher in Anatolia until the age of thirty-seven, when he came under the influence of a whirling dervish, Shams Tabriz, and was moved to a state of mystical ecstasy. One of the results of this ecstasy was a prodigious output of poems about the search for the lost Divine Beloved, whom Rumi identified with Shams. To symbolize this search, Rumi also invented the famous whirling dance of the Melevi dervishes, which are performed accompanied by the chanting of Rumi's poems. Professor Schimmel illuminates the symbolism and significance of Rumi's vast output and offers her own translations of some of his most famous poems.</p><p>Annemarie Schimmel is an international authority on Islamic religion and literature and especially the works of Rumi. The author of over seventy books, she is now retired from Harvard University and the University of Bonn but continues to lecture worldwide."Annemarie Schimmel has been immersed in Rumi for over forty years. Her scholarship and devotion are magnificent. She has a deep understanding of the poems, the mystical puns, the music, and the dancy inner meanings of Rumi's work."&#x2014;Coleman Barks, author of <i>The Essential Rumi. </i></p><h2>Flaubert and Madame Bovary</h2><p>Francis Steegmuller&#39;s beautifully executed double portrait of Madame Bovary and her maker is a remarkable and unusual biographical study, a sensitive and detailed account of how an unpromising young man turns himself into one of the world&#39;s greatest novelists. Steegmuller starts with the young Flaubert, prone to mysterious fits, hypochondriacal, at odds with and yet dependent on his bourgeois family. Then, drawing on Flaubert&#39;s voluminous correspondence, Steegmuller tracks his subject through friendships and love affairs, a trip to the Orient, nervous breakdown and tenuous recovery, and finally into the study, where a mind at once restless and jaded finds a focus in the precisely detailed reality of an imagined woman, utterly ordinary in her unhappiness, whose story was to revolutionize literature.</p><p><b>Francis Steegmuller </b>was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1906, and educated in the public schools of Greenwich and at Columbia University. He was the author of many works about French culture and its great literary figures; translator of Gustave Flaubert&#x2019;s letters and of the Modern Library edition of <i>Madame Bovary</i>. He was the recipient of many literary honors, including the National Book Award for his biography of Jean Cocteau, and he was a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.<br><br>Steegmuller divided his life between New York City and Europe.

He has published extensively on Flaubert, both in this country and in France.<p>"This is the best biography of a novelist I have come across." Anne Enright in <i>O,</i> <i>The Oprah Magazine</i></p><p>"In his segregation of the relevant from a tempting superfluity of information Mr. Steegmuller shows himself a true biographer.

These technological marvels promise cleaner air, smoother traffic, and tens of thousands of lives saved. But even if robots turn into responsible drivers, are we ready to be a nation of passengers?</p><p>In <em>Are We There Yet?</em>, Dan Albert combines historical scholarship with personal narrative to explore how car culture has suffused America&#x2019;s DNA. The plain, old-fashioned, human-driven car built our economy, won our wars, and shaped our democratic creed as it moved us about. Driver&#x2019;s ed made teenagers into citizens; auto repair made boys into men.</p><p>Crusades against the automobile are nothing new. Its arrival sparked battles over street space, pitting the masses against the millionaires who terrorized pedestrians. When the masses got cars of their own, they learned to love driving too. During World War II, Washington nationalized Detroit and postwar Americans embraced car and country as if they were one. Then came 1960s environmentalism and the energy crises of the 1970s. Many predicted, even welcomed, the death of the automobile. But many more rose to its defense. They embraced trucker culture and took to Citizen Band radios, demanding enough gas to keep their big boats afloat. Since the 1980s, the car culture has triumphed and we now drive more miles than ever before.</p><p>Have we reached the end of the road this time? Fewer young people are learning to drive. Ride hailing is replacing car buying, and with electrification a long and noble tradition of amateur car repair&#x2015;to say nothing of the visceral sound of gasoline exploding inside a big V8&#x2015;will come to an end. When a robot takes over the driver&#x2019;s seat, what&#x2019;s to become of us?</p><p><em>Are We There Yet?</em> carries us from muddy tracks to superhighways, from horseless buggies to driverless electric vehicles. Like any good road trip, it&#x2019;s an adventure so fun you don&#x2019;t even notice how much you&#x2019;ve learned along the way.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p>Dan Albert holds a PhD in history from the University of Michigan.

Karon lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.<p>1</p><p>Mitford</p><p>Thursday, October 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was the first day of October, and all things considered, Mitford was pretty quiet.</p><p>Around the tenth of the month is when it would hit the fan. The chlorophylls of summer foliage would have degraded into non�fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites, and hidden pigments would explode in a pyrotechnic extravagance of scarlet, gold, vermilion, and out-loud �yellow.</p><p>While the display would be rampant throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains, Mitford was proud to offer its very own autumn expo:</p><p>A brace of mature&nbsp;<i>Acer rubrum,&nbsp;</i>which paraded from Town Hall to First Baptist. Such annual spectacle would not be missed by tourists in the hundreds, steaming up the mountain with the ubiquitous cell phone and occasional Nikon.</p><p>There was, however, a caveat. There were now two gaps in the parade of maples. One where lightning had struck in 2005 and the other where trunk rot had finally dealt its fatal blow.</p><p>The Council had ordered the stump ground and the vacant sites disguised with mulch. Mitford had not enjoyed a furor in quite a while and somehow, collectively, had decided the time had come.</p><p>A party of locals demanded that the maples be replaced, full-size, which would cost the town a bundle. Others campaigned to replant with beds of pansies, historically known as the town flower. A group calling themselves the Vocal Locals objected to pine bark mulch as too acidic for the soil and pressed for cocoa bean hulls, which others rejected outright as &#x2018;too foreign.&#x2019;</p><p>Esther Cunningham&#x2019;s copy of the weekly&nbsp;<i>Muse</i>&nbsp;hit the porch at seven-thirty sharp; she read the feature on the trees while cranked back in her recliner.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t served as Mitford&#x2019;s mayor, albeit former, for nothing. She knew about such things. People were right about th&#x2019; pine bark&#x2014;get it offa there and go with th&#x2019; pansies. How often did they get a blank spot to drop in a couple flats of pansies? As for replacement, no. Nobody in their right mind would go for the cost of spading in mature trees, and young stock would look ridiculous among their elders.</p><p>After sixteen nose-to-the-grindstone years, she&#x2019;d been retired for how long? Too long! She had sworn never to run for office again, but didn&#x2019;t people change their minds all the time and so what if she was gaining on ninety?</p><p>Take th&#x2019; woman in England who was a hundred and still tend-� in&#x2019;&nbsp;bar&#x2014;pullin&#x2019; pints, she called it, three days a week. And that&nbsp;�hundred-year-old gal writin&#x2019; for a newspaper, askin&#x2019; people, Got any news?</p><p>And how about th&#x2019; mayor who was still mayorin&#x2019; at a hundred an&#x2019; two, bless &#x2019;er heart? Just lately, she dropped dead comin&#x2019; out of a council meeting, which was no surprise. How many of those monkey shows had she, Esther Cunningham, barely escaped with her life?</p><p>She located the remote in the pocket of the recliner, cranked upright, and reached for her iPad.</p><p>Havin&#x2019; an iPad had opened a whole new world. Her daughters could no longer accuse her of bein&#x2019; Stone<i>&nbsp;</i>Age; she knew what was goin&#x2019; on out there with people livin&#x2019; longer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At seven thirty-five, Father Tim Kavanagh dropped a frozen banana, half a package of frozen acai berries, and a handful of frozen mangoes and peaches into a blender. The m�lange was followed by a container of Greek yogurt, a spoonful of tahini, and a long pour of almond milk.</p><p>He hit the Blend button while firmly holding down the lid. Completely new to the smoothie regimen, he was alarmed by the possibility of the lid flying off and splattering stuff all over the kitchen. But the blender wouldn&#x2019;t blend. It sounded like an eighteen-wheeler spinning tires on a sheet of ice.</p><p>He hit Off and reviewed the options.</p><p>Puree, Whip, Mix, Stir, Grind, Frapp�.</p><p>Grind did not work. Same with the other options.</p><p>Okay, so some of the contents were frozen like a rock; maybe they had to partially thaw. When the nurse gave him the recipe after his physical, she didn&#x2019;t say the ingredients had to be thawed. He did not have time to wait for something to thaw. He hit Blend again. A sound like tires screaming on a NASCAR track.</p><p>This would be his first morning without caffeine. Whether he could live up to the caffeine-free regimen recommended by Dr. Wilson, he couldn&#x2019;t say. He was totally hooked on coffee and had been for decades. Cut him some slack, for Pete&#x2019;s sake. Let him cling to this harmless vice.</p><p>He removed the lid and looked in. Maybe if he stuck a knife down in there and broke up the frozen chunks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>So, okay, you cannot put in big chunks, they have to be broken up first, because that worked pretty well and now the blender was sort of blending. This smoothie business was no walk in the park. He&#x2019;d had trouble opening the package of frozen acai berries and resorted to sawing through the wrapper with a bread knife. Acai berries, whey, tahini&#x2014;�such exotic items were not available at the Local; he&#x2019;d been forced to drive to the neighboring Wesley, a college town in which such products thrived.</p><p>He emptied the contents of the blender into a large glass for himself and one for Cynthia, who would be coming downstairs any minute, and since Puny was taking a few weeks off, he was careful to do a cleanup.</p><p>He carried the glasses to the study, glancing beyond what they called their &#x2018;picture window&#x2019; to a view of their own&nbsp;<i>Acer rubrum</i>. The crimson was as yet a mere blush, and there were the blue mountains beyond, illumined by the blast of pure, clean light that happens when the earth does its autumnal tilt.</p><p>He put the glasses on the table, sat on the sofa. To be honest, he wasn&#x2019;t completely excited about today&#x2019;s agenda.</p><p>They would be lugging the contents of Cynthia&#x2019;s workroom up the hall to the dining room, now vacant of the pool table, which had recently moved to Meadowgate Farm, hallelujah.</p><p>He visualized the countless tubes of paint and brushes, boxes of colored pencils and pens, and the tons of finished art that had happily leaned against a wall for a decade or two, plus the contents of a massive wooden file cabinet wherein resided the complete history of her life as a writer/illustrator of children&#x2019;s books. Then there was all the stuff pushpinned to the wall that had served as images of encouragement: faded prints of Matisse paintings, her grandfather on a pony at the age of nine, newspaper and trade journal accounts of her many awards and recognitions, innumerable photos of white cats in various poses&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Lug, haul, schlep, tote&#x2014;that was the way of marriage. As a bachelor, he had never moved anything. Every item in the rectory had been deeply, and for his money happily, rooted in place.</p><p>He checked his watch.</p><p>They would have to be dressed and out of here at twelve-fifteen for Esther Cunningham&#x2019;s birthday luncheon at the club, and after the big bash, come home and have at it again. But he wouldn&#x2019;t grumble. The new workspace would be reviving for his wife, who had for years hunkered down in quarters the size of a shoebox.</p><p>He looked across the room where Truman slept in a wingback chair, undisturbed by dreams of preying hawks or the one-upmanship of barn cats. A cat as white as chalk, except for a black ear, was a red flag to rural predators, including fox and bear. Clearly Truman had considered the odds and made a decision to leave Meadowgate Farm. He was discovered yesterday on the backseat of Cynthia&#x2019;s new Mini Cooper Roadster. When she arrived home and opened the car door to take out a sack of squash from the farm garden, Truman had jumped down and dived for their kitchen door. Home free!</p><p>And here was his wife, a vision in sweats and fuzzy slippers.</p><p>&#x2018;This is the day the Lord has made!&#x2019; she said.</p><p>He lifted his glass. &#x2018;Let us rejoice and be glad in it!&#x2019;</p><p>She thumped onto the sofa, took her glass from the table. Smelled the contents.</p><p>&#x2018;What is this?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a smoothie, the first of ten commandments from Wilson. It contains calcium to help restore bones.&#x2019;&nbsp;<i>Osteo</i>&nbsp;was the dark word the nurse had used.&nbsp;<i>That&#x2019;s where this is headed if you don&#x2019;t shape up, Father.</i></p><p>Cynthia took a sip and looked at him, wordless.</p><p>&#x2018;I think I forgot the whey,&#x2019; he said.</p><p>&#x2018;<i>Whey?</i>&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The recipe calls for whey, but I forgot. Here&#x2019;s lookin&#x2019; at you, kid.&#x2019; He drank half the stuff, just to show that he could.</p><p>She tried again. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a blob of something in here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I think there&#x2019;s supposed to be a blob or two.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But a smoothie is supposed to be smooth.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Blobs are good for you.&#x2019; It was his final argument.</p><p>She took another sip, tentative. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t do this. I&#x2019;ll settle for the bones of Elijah, dry as they may be. But thank you, sweetheart.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We also have to start walking, Kav&#x2019;na. Every day. A hundred and fifty minutes a week, total. Should be easy. Oh, and do weight-bearing exercises.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Is this your medical protocol or my medical protocol?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mine, really, but your bone density test is due next week and you&#x2019;ll need the same treatment, trust me. It&#x2019;s an old-age thing.&#x2019;</p><p>She gave him a look. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re caving to the notion of old age.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not caving, just being realistic.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Realistically, I must begin painting today. The Children&#x2019;s Hospital auction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Realistically, the auction is nearly six months away. April!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Six months will be gone in a blink. Irene and I are committing to fifteen new paintings each. The work sold so well last time, we want to be even better this year. It isn&#x2019;t easy to be better each year.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Tell me about it.&#x2019;</p><p>So she would be absent from this galaxy until the last brush was cleaned and put away. For years he&#x2019;d been jealous of her creative passions, but in recent years had learned to support and encourage her&#x2014;a strategy which, ironically, returned her to him in surprising ways.</p><p>He heard the&nbsp;<i>Muse</i>&nbsp;truck slow down, then roar away.</p><p>&#x2018;The&nbsp;<i>Muse</i>!&#x2019; he cried. &#x2018;Drink up, girl, we have work to do!&#x2019;</p><p>He went to the door and brought the newspaper in; he would just take a minute to check LOL, aka the laugh of the week.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t have to look far.</p><p>&#x2018;Mitford School Students,&#x2019; declared the front-page headline, &#x2018;Make Delicious Snacks.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mitford&#x2019;s police captain shocked herself by running a red light&#x2014;indeed, the only traffic light in town.</p><p>She was mortified. She looked both ways on Lilac Road, ahead on Main, and into the rearview mirror. Had anyone witnessed this? All clear, thank the Lord. That was unusual for a weekday morning, but in a town like Mitford, even the bushes had eyes. She was born with a lead foot, and she&#x2019;d been hauling to make it to the station for a special meeting of the day shift.</p><p>She wheeled into the parking lot as the church bells at Lord&#x2019;s Chapel began their eight o&#x2019;clock chime.&nbsp;<i>Bong&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bong&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>She was an honest woman; should she write herself a citation? Adele Hogan, MPD police captain, grandmother, churchgoer, wife of local newspaper editor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>She was struck then by something like an aftershock. She realized she hadn&#x2019;t just run the light, she had been speeding. Her heart was kicking like a horse at the stall door. She got out of the patrol car and adjusted her holster with the new&nbsp;.40-caliber Sig Sauer. She hadn&#x2019;t been doing more than five or six miles per hour&#x2014;okay, ten&#x2014;over the limit, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Two offenses. If her mama knew this, she would roll over in her grave. A citation would send her to court where they would march her fool self off to driving school. Her face burned. If she did not opt for driving school, she would have to pay court costs and a fine. Five hundred bucks. If she opted for school, the DA could probably be moved to reduce the charges for a first offender, but there would still be points on her driver&#x2019;s license, an increase in her insurance premiums, and nobody in town, much less the MPD, would let her forget it.</p><p>As if that wasn&#x2019;t punishment enough, the whole miserable incident would land on the station log, engraved in stone, which is when it would go from bad to worse.</p><p>Everybody knew Vanita Bentley checked the log five days a week, prowling for any scrap she could splash across the front page of the&nbsp;<i>Mitford Muse</i>, owned by the husband of the MPD police captain.</p><p>Her husband would sell his grandma for a good story. But even if it didn&#x2019;t circulate in the newspaper, it would definitely circulate by&nbsp;<i>word of&nbsp;mouth</i>. Roughly twenty minutes is what it took for news to spread through Mitford like a brush fire.</p><p>As she opened the station door, her heart was doing a number under the badge she had worn for six years plus change.</p><p>Why was she making herself miserable? Nobody had witnessed it. What was the big deal? Maybe it was her new blood pressure med.</p><p>She breathed in.</p><p>So, okay. No citation.</p><p>Really, all she needed was a reminder. Something she could keep in her sock drawer where J.C. would never lay eyes on it, but she would see it every morning.</p><p>She breathed out.</p><p>Yes. Good. She would write herself a warning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coot Hendrick was feeling entirely cured. Upper respiratory somethin&#x2019; or other&#x2014;he could not recall exactly what had made him so sick. All he knew was, he had never smoked, so his conscience was clear. He stood at the big window in his upstairs apartment over Happy Endings bookstore and worked out his list for the day.</p><p>He would finally be able to do everything that needed doin&#x2019;: Vacuum the store, wash the front windows, haul off the recycling, dust the books, an&#x2019; whatever else Miz Murphy and Sister Louise wanted him to do, or even Grace, who sometimes asked him to catch her a frog or a housefly or a turtle so she could draw it.</p><p>Get stamps, he needed to get stamps for their mail-order business. An&#x2019; put his bedclothes in th&#x2019; washer in the basement. It would be nice to have clean bedclothes to look forward to when he finished his book tonight, and Lord knows, he hated to finish it. He&#x2019;d got so used to that book, it was like he was livin&#x2019; in a whole other place.</p><p>He remembered there was a piece of Miz Bolick&#x2019;s Orange Marmalade Cake still in the freezer. He would set that out to thaw and eat it tonight after he finished his book. He got a shiver of joy rememberin&#x2019; how that cake looked settin&#x2019; on his little table and how it was just for him, to help him get well. Miz Bolick had brought it up to the store and said to Miz Murphy, &#x2018;This is for Coot, who is one of Mitford&#x2019;s town fixtures.&#x2019; It was a solemn honor to be called a town fixture.<br><br></p></p><h2>The Elephant from Baghdad</h2><p>Who would have thought that the emperor Charlemagne would make friends with an albino elephant, a gift from the caliph of Baghdad? Told from the fictionalized point of view of a monk who set down the actual story in 883 884 CE, the book follows the elephant&#39;s journey through Egypt, across the Mediterranean to Italy and across the Alps to Germany. When the elephant finally reaches his destination, Charlemagne is so delighted with his exotic new pet that he introduces him to his many children and bathes with him in the hot springs near his palace. When the elephant dies of old age, the emperor is heartbroken. Jon Cannell invigorates his charming mixed-media artwork with artifacts, paintings, and sculpture from earlier centuries. An Author&#39;s Note about the origins of the story and the remarkable water clock carried by the elephant is included.</p><p>Author Mary Tavener Holmes lives in New York, New York.Holmes, Harris and Cannel (<em>A Giraffe Goes to Paris</em>, 2010) again team up to tell a tale about a large exotic animal who historically ventured into European/Western territory. This time they reach back into the first millennium to look at a cross-cultural bridge constructed in the 9th century, when Charlemagne was emperor of most of Europe. The first-person narrative in the voice of the chronicling monk of St. Gall, Notker the Stammerer, tells how the emperor was interested in Harun al-Rashid, the famed caliph of Baghdad. Charlemagne dispatches some of his men to travel to Baghdad to meet with Harun. Charlemagne&#x2019;s emissaries to Harun&#x2019;s beautiful city are treated with interest and respect, introduced to &#x201c;artists, musicians, scholars, mathematicians, architects, and poets&#x201d; and sent home with extraordinary gifts. These include a wondrous mechanical clock, multiple treasures and an albino elephant named Abu and his Jewish caretaker, Isaac. They journey westward, following the same route across the Alps taken by Hannibal 500 years earlier. Cannel&#x2019;s ink-and-watercolor illustration is endearingly old-fashioned: simple, whimsical and sophisticated at the same time, reminiscent of Virginia Kahl and Laurent de Brunhoff in its expressive cartoon lines and lively scenes. An authors&#x2019; note provides more information on the historical Notker the Stammerer and the famous clock, as well as providing sources for their story. Captivating and charming both as animal story and as a glimpse of historical East/West relations. <em>(Picture book. 4-10) -Kirkus April 1, 2012<br></em></p><h2>The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut (Modern Library (Paperback))</h2><p>In 1934, famed British traveler Freya Stark sailed down the Red Sea, alighting in Aden, located at the tip of the Arabian peninsula. From this backwater outpost, Stark set forth on what was to be her most unforgettable adventure: Following the ancient frankincense routes of the Hadhramaut Valley, the most fertile in Arabia, she sought to be the first Westerner to locate and document the lost city of Shabwa. Chronicling her journey through the towns and encampments of the Hadhramaut, <b>The Southern Gates of Arabia</b> is a tale alive with sheikhs and sultans, tragedy and triumph. Although the claim to discovering Shabwa would not ultimately be Stark's, <b>The Southern Gates of Arabia</b>, a bestseller upon its original publication, remains a classic in the literature of travel. This edition includes a new Introduction by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, Stark's biographer.</p><p>In 1934, a 42-year-old Englishwoman named Freya Stark arrived in the British-governed Protectorate of Aden on a singular mission: to locate the fabled, long-lost city of Shabwa.<p> Located on the high Hadramaut plateau in what is now Yemen, Shabwa was renowned in antiquity as the source of frankincense. Little visited even then, it was also thought to be a particularly forbidding place; Genesis mentions it as the "enclosure of death," and the Roman geographer Pliny reported that it contained 60 great temples and wealth beyond measure. That was good enough for Stark, who, having not long before made a difficult passage across the badlands of Iran, thrived on improbable adventures. And so, by burro and whatever mechanical conveyances she could find, she ascended the high mountains into a world that was sometimes perilous, but that also sometimes approached fairy-tale dimensions, as when, climbing the Hadramaut, she writes, "The path kept high and open, until gradually the valley clefts narrowed again upon us, and shut us in walls whose luxuriant green made a romantic landscape of the kind usually only invented in pictures."</p><p> Stark never reached Shabwa; laid low by measles, she had to be evacuated from territory overrun in any event by warring religious factions and gangs of bandits. Though cut short, her time in the Yemeni highlands yielded this superb travel narrative, full of uncommon vistas and milieus (harems, bazaars, and Bedouin camps among them). Anyone who values tales of adventure well told will find Stark's body of work--and this book in particular--to be full of treasures. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Extraordinarily rich and authoritative... a book to treasure."<br>--<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"[Freya Stark] writes angelically in the great tradition of Charles Doughty and T. E. Lawrence. The pulse quickens as you read, because she can bring the sights and sounds of incredible countries before you in the twinkling of an eye."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Stark unites in one mind the traveller, the historian, the philosopher, and the poet."<br>--<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> (London)<br></p><h2>The Pueblo Revolt of 1680</h2><p><p>In August 1680 the Pueblo Indians of northern New Mexico arose in fury to slay their Spanish colonial overlords and drive any survivors from the land. Andrew Knaut explores eight decades of New Mexican history leading up to the revolt, explaining how the newcomers had disrupted Pueblo life in far-reaching ways - they commandeered the Indians&#x2019; food stores, exposed the Pueblos to new diseases, interrupted long-established trading relationships, and sparked increasing raids by surrounding Athapaskan nomads. The Pueblo Indians&#x2019; violent success stemmed from an almost unprecedented unity of disparate factions and sophistication of planning in secrecy. When Spanish forces retook the colony in the 1690s, freedom proved short-lived. But the revolt stands as a vitally important yet neglected historical landmark: the only significant reversal of European expansion by Native American people in the New World.</p></p><p><p><strong>Andrew Knaut</strong> holds the doctorate in history from Duke University. <em>The Pueblo Revolt of 1680</em> is his first book.</p></p><h2>The Night Life of Trees</h2><p><p>In the belief of the Gond tribe, the lives of humans and trees are closely entwined. Trees contain the cosmos; when night falls, the spirits they nurture glimmer into life.</p><p>A visual ode to trees rendered by tribal artists from India, this handcrafted edition showcases three of the finest living Gond masters. This collection of their distinctive styles is enchanting&#x2014;an excellent gift for those fascinated by trees, art or folk traditions.</p></p><p>Durga Bai is a young woman tribal artist from the Gond tradition of central India. Gond is a ritual and functional art style with distinctive decorative elements, mostly painted on walls of houses, using natural colours. Durga Bai constantly re-works and pushes the borders of the Gond art form to create art that sparkles with a distinctive energy. Bhajju Shyam, of the acclaimed The Night Life of Trees, is the finest living artist of the Gond tribe in India. Intricate and colourful, Bhajju&#39;s work is well-known throughout India and has been exhibited in the UK, Germany, Holland and Russia. From the walls of his tribal village home to international acclaim, Bhajju&#39;s has been an incredible creative journey. Ram Singh Urveti, an artist from central India, is one of the most brilliant living artists of the Gond tradition. Ram Singh&#39;s work has spread the myths and stories of the Gond community throughout Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America and has won him awards nationally and internationally. His work creates a world of fantasy and metamorphosis, coming alive with finely detailed organic forms.<i>Starred Review.</i> Tara Publishing, a commune of artists, writers and designers producing handmade books in Chennai (formerly Madras), India, have created a glowingly mysterious and charming volume that combines mythology from central India's Gond tribe with illustrations from three renowned Gond artists who will appear at museums in several U.S. cities this year. Hand screened onto black paper, the colorful, intricately detailed illustrations are almost psychedelic, in some ways reminiscent of Australian Aboriginal drawings. But the forms are recognizably Indian, and despite stylistic differences among the three artists, the pictures reveal a strong and unique Gond artistic tradition where animals, insects and humans merge with and emerge from the trees. There are magical stories about the protective spirits of the Sambar tree, and the serpent and root-entwined snake goddesses holding the earth together. But the practical uses of trees figure here as well: the wood of the thorny Nagphani tree is hard enough to use as a crowbar, and its sap heals sore eyes; the Ganja (marijuana) bush and the Mahua (alcohol) tree are said to be husband and wife. This mingling of the mythic, mundane and poetic gives an alluring glimpse into an integrative worldview that's in poignant contrast to the fragmented postmodern world. <i>(June 1)</i>Correction: In the review of <i>Endgame,</i> by Derrick Jensen (Reviews, May 8), the final sentence should read, "But he has become so disgusted with what he calls 'civilization' that he has more compassion for the salmon than for his fellow humans." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He also realized <b>his own negative feelings</b> were what he had struggled so hard and long against. And, this struggle was what had destroyed his health and caused him to suffer in every way.<br> <br> The second truth is he discovered he had the inborn ability to <b>let go</b> of his negative feelings. He discovered <b> how</b> to completely discharge them and suppressing, coping and venting as he had previously done, he discovered <b>how</b> to totally release them. This put an end to his struggle! He found permanent happiness. And, he found the more he released his negative feelings, the happier and healthier he became. In fact, within three months he was completely <b>well</b>, and he stayed well for over 40 more years!<br> <br> Lester discovered something else - every aspect of his live fot better, too. A short time later he became a millionaire!<br> <br> You know from your own experience, that when too many negative feelings build up in you, you feel anxious, uncomfortable and unhappy. The first thing you'll try to do is get away from them. You'll do this by suppressing them (hiding them from yourself is the worst thing you can do), coping with them (trying to escape their effects by various means), or by venting them.<br> <br> Lawrence Crane<br> Author, Lecturer, Self-Made Millionaire</p><h2>The Philosopher&#39;s Secret Fire: A History of the Imagination</h2><p>The visionary tradition of spirits, gods, and demons continues to subvert our rational universe, erupting from the shadows in times of intense religious and philosophical transition.

By the early 1950s all four were settled in Manhattan, collaborating, competing and encouraging each other&#39;s radical experiments with language and form. Much of their work reflects their participation in the creative energies of the New York art scene, &#39;the floods of paint&#39;, to quote James Schuyler, &#39;in whose crashing surf we all scramble&#39;. Believing that anything could be material for a poem, they transformed American poetry with their irreverent wit and daring. Mark Ford&#39;s anthology is an essential introduction to four poets whose work has influenced poetry around the world. It includes detailed background information and a substantial bibliography.</p><p>MARK FORD was born in 1962. His publications include two collections of poetry, Landlocked (Chatto, 1992, 1998) and Soft Sift (Faber, 2001); a critical biography of Raymond Roussel; a substantial interview with John Ashbery (Between the Lines, 2003) and a selection of the poems of Frank O&#39;Hara for Carcanet (&#39;Why I Am Not a Painter&#39; and other poems). He contributes to the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books. He teaches at University College London. TREVOR WINKFIELD was born in Leeds in 1944. He exhibits his paintings at Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York, and has recently published a collaboration with the poet Kenward Elmslie, Snippets.

In 2001, then-27-year-old Chad Hymas had everything a beautiful wife, two sons, two thriving businesses and parents and brothers who loved and supported him in everything he did. It seemed he couldn t fail. Everything he touched turned to gold. And then a rushed decision to ignore safety in favor of getting home to see his baby boy take his first steps changed everything forever. A few minutes of caution could ve kept his golden life on track, and he would live to regret his decision until he changed his mind about what his life was for. Ultimately, Chad Hymas spent many weeks in the hospital and in physical therapy. The doctors determined that psychological therapy wasn t needed, but Chad had another kind of help. He met Art Berg, another quadriplegic, who introduced himself without a word but with plenty of action. And Chad was paying attention. That was the day he began to change his mind about his life s purpose. With desperation, dedication and determination, and the help and love of his family and friends, Chad set out to reinvent himself, take risks, and do things he never thought he could or would do, even when his body was whole and fully functional. He had plenty of black periods to work through, to let go of his old ideas about who he was supposed to be, and the anger and frustration of not being able to be that. It hasn t been an easy journey, but it has transformed him into a man unlike anything he ever thought he could or would be. He s dedicated his life to service for others who have lost functionality, or perhaps never had it. He became a living example of what is possible, if one is willing to invent different ways to do what has to be done. In order to teach others, he had to invent those new and different ways of doing things for himself. He had to walk the talk. Now... He opens minds, eyes, hearts and doors for people just like himself. He helps people who have all their faculties to become more than they think they can be. He inspires children and adults alike, those with challenges and those without. He helps companies to work better by coming together, and teaches families and caretakers new ways to help those they care for. In the ten years since his accident, Chad travels the world, speaking to companies, kids in schools at all grade levels, families and individuals whose lives are being remolded by their own events. He has become the living demonstration of what is possible, if we find different ways of doing what must be done. His life changed forever and now, he changes lives.</p><p>On April 3, 2001, Chad was involved in a serious accident leaving him a quadriplegic. Chad s dreams were not paralyzed that day. Since that fateful event Chad has done the following: Started Chad Hymas Communications, Inc., a professional speaking company, designed to motivate businesses and corporations to use their wings and reach seemingly impossible heights.

Speaking on 5 Continents and 4 Countries Chad has shared his personal message and entertained many audiences from organizations such as Wells Fargo, Blue Cross Blue Shields, Ford, IHC, Coca Cola, and the Utah Jazz. He is a member of the National Speakers Association and is a CSP (Certified Speaking Professional). A designation achieved by fewer than 8% in the speaking industry. He was most recently inducted into the Speaker Hall Of Fame. The past president of the National Speakers Association Utah chapter.

Participating in wheelchair athletic competition including basketball, rugby, wheelchair racing, and officiating basketball (a dream come true). Spending many hours with other injured individuals in therapy, encouraging them to overcome their challenges, focus on dreams and make them a reality, and to love life for all that it has to offer. To achieve the unachievable and to reach for the unreachable. Chad s greatest accomplishment is that he remains a devoted husband to his loving wife Shondell, and proud father to their four children Christian, Kyler, Jordan, and Gracee!When I get to know someone I can tell whether they are a person of depth or not. Chad Hymas is a man of tremendous depth. His character and his intellect are both impressive. I've seen Chad in the early years of rebuilding his career in a totally new field, and I've seen him as he was installed into the Professional Speakers Hall of Fame, last summer in Anaheim. This is a man you will want to spend time with, in print or in person. Follow his works, attend his presentations and apply his wisdom. He'll help you be a better person. --Jim Cathcart "Motivation &amp; Sales Expert"<br><br>Chad Hymas tells about his experience and accident.

Enjoy the video as we take a walk through "Doing What Must Be Done" by Chad Hymas. --Terry L., Brock<br><br>I purchased this book because I was motivated to learn more about Chad after he challenged my daughter to serve ice cream for dinner when he spoke to her group in Illinois. I was amazed that he could get my very focused daughter to do something like this. After following Chad's Facebook site and reading his book, I now understand. This is one man who can do anything he sets his mind to, and his ability to break goals down into individual steps is encouraging to all of us who have been overwhelmed by the "mountain before us". One of my favorite things about this book is that it doesn't read like most motivational books. It's not dry, it's not all sad. This is Chad's story and there are tears and shock as well as realistic fears. There is also great love, laughter and celebration. Take the chance and read this book. I believe you will read it again and again. --Kim Rodgers "CEO, Your Travel Experts"</p><h2>From Wolf to Woof: The Story of Dogs</h2><p><b>"It's hard to imagine the child&#x2014;story-lover or fact-lover, dog-lover or not&#x2014;who would not be drawn in by this book."&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>How did dog become man&#x2019;s best friend? Dogs come in such a variety of shapes, sizes, and breeds, that it is hard to believe that they all have a common ancestor--the wolf! Hudson Talbott takes readers on a fascinating journey through history to see how wolves&#x2019; relationships with humans sparked their development into the dogs we know and love today. <br> &nbsp;<br> Striking paintings, from an adorable wolf pup to a wide range of modern-day dog breeds, illustrate this insightful story of teamwork and friendship. Through the eyes of a prehistoric boy and a lone wolf pup, we see how the bond between our ancestors and these wild animals may have developed. Starting as enemies competing for food, the wolf and the boy realize that they&#x2019;ll eat better and be safer if they team up. Over time, others catch on, and as many of the wolves become more domesticated, the humans breed them for skills like hunting, herding, pulling, and rescuing. And today, there are more breeds of dog than of any other animal, all thanks to this relationship that started so long ago.</p><p><b>Hudson Talbott</b> (www.hudsontalbott.com) wrote and illustrated <i>United Tweets of America</i>, <i>River of Dreams</i>, and<i> It&#x2019;s All About Me-ow</i>, and he has illustrated numerous picture books, including Newbery Honor winner <i>Show Way </i>(by Jacqueline Woodson) and <i>Leonardo&#x2019;s Horse </i>(by Jean Fritz), an ALA Notable Book and a VOYA Honor Book.

She drives a brand-new car and lives in a large brick colonial, complete with an Olympic-size swimming pool. Pretty and popular, she reigns as both the captain of the cheerleading squad and girlfriend of the football team captain. With a 4.0 grade point average, the teen has been accepted to all three of her top college choices. But cracks in Whitney's idyllic life begin to surface when she gets a D on a Calculus test. Outraged, her critical and controlling mother demands that Whitney bring her grade up with the help of a tutor. Enter Taylor Martinez, a motorcycle-riding math genius from the wrong side of town. What starts off as a rebellious flirtation evolves into true love, as the two young people bond over their deep, shared faith in God. Fans of YA Christian fiction will appreciate the guiding role which prayer plays in Whitney's journey toward self-discovery. Unfortunately, readers who enjoyed Clipston's Roadside Assistance (Zondervan, 2011) will be disappointed by this book's comparative lack of authenticity and depth. A narrow worldview persists throughout and conveys a certain judgmental smugness. For example, Whitney feels "truly blessed to come from a family that was still intact," while Taylor is pitied for "growing up without a father."

It resides in expected and unexpected places in our world. Beauty is present in our world in a variety of forms. Yet while the average person might think about the reality of beauty from time to time, few people would think about the source of beauty. Where does beauty come from? Why is it here?<br><br>Several hundred years ago Jonathan Edwards did some thinking of his own on this difficult subject. This volume explores his meditation on the subject and lays out a Christian framework for understanding and experiencing the beauty God has planted in His world.<br><br>Edwards found in the study of beauty the person of God. Where Edwards saw beautiful images and acts, he saw a representation, a small picture, of a reality too great to comprehend, a God too majestic to adequately adore. He sets in motion a path of glory that begins with the Lord, moves to creation, continues to the incarnation of Christ, moves to the church, and ascends to the glory of heaven, where the Holy Trinity dwells.<br><br>Easily accessible and readable, you do not need to be a scholar to enjoy these insights about Jonathan Edwards and his writings.</p><p><b>OWEN STRACHAN</b> is Associate Professor of Christian Theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide. <br><br>Then out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.<br><br>Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future. <br><br>But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be...</p><p><i>Slow River</i> won both the Nebula Award and the Lambda Literary Award for author Nicola Griffith. The book's near-future setting and devices place it firmly on the science fiction shelves, and the characters' matter-of-fact sexuality further label it as lesbian SF. But make no mistake, <i>Slow River</i> is no subgenre throwaway. Griffith's skill at weaving temporal threads through the plot bring protagonist Lore van de Oest to tragic life, and you will genuinely care about her in the end. <p> Born into a bioengineering family made wealthy by cleaning up after humanity, Lore leads a life of privilege and power. Riches don't bring happiness, though, and the van de Oest family hides its share of dark secrets. Lore is kidnapped, but escapes from her captors when she realizes her family isn't going to pay the ransom. Naked, alone, and wounded, she is saved by the brutally street-smart Spanner, who teaches Lore to survive by exploiting the Net (and human) weaknesses. To learn to trust, though, Lore must face her demons, one by one, until she can begin again.</p><p> Griffith's biotech-science details are accurate, and she fits them smoothly into the story in the manner of a cyberpunk master. This novel's real strength is its characters, though. The van de Oest family, Spanner, even characters who appear only briefly, are all distinct and consistent--not to mention very human. Lore herself seems so personal that Griffith's note about the story's disturbing aspects not being autobiographical was probably wise. <i>Slow River</i> is more than good enough to transcend genre and appeal to both queer SF readers and a more broad audience looking for an excellent character-driven SF story. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>This is one of my favorite books I've ever edited--because it's extremely well written, deals with the near future in a realistic way, and has great characters, plus a narrative structure that's complex and interesting (unlike many SF novels). The science-fictional developments it tackles, primarily bioremediation, are on the cusp of happening today. The story really sucks you in.

Our Del Rey cover designer put together various photo elements, rather than commissioning a painting: the face, the bubbly water, the microscopic creatures behind the "SLOW RIVER" type, the two halves of the face out of alignment with one another.

Jewish identity is tied up with some of the most difficult and contentious issues of today. The purpose in this book is to open many of these issues up for discussion. Since Israel defines itself openly as the &#x2018;Jewish State&#x2019;, we should ask what the notions of &#x2019;Judaism&#x2019;, &#x2018;Jewishness&#x2019;, &#x2018;Jewish culture&#x2019; and &#x2018;Jewish ideology&#x2019; stand for. Gilad examines the tribal aspects embedded in Jewish secular discourse, both Zionist and anti Zionist; the &#x2018;holocaust religion&#x2019;; the meaning of &#x2018;history&#x2019; and &#x2018;time&#x2019; within the Jewish political discourse; the anti-Gentile ideologies entangled within different forms of secular Jewish political discourse and even within the Jewish left. He questions what it is that leads Diaspora Jews to identify themselves with Israel and affiliate with its politics. The devastating state of our world affairs raises an immediate demand for a conceptual shift in our intellectual and philosophical attitude towards politics, identity politics and history.</p></p><p>Atzmon is a world-acclaimed jazz saxophonist and composer, a member of the Blockheads and fronts the Orient House Ensemble.

The author suggests that, like the black holes of outer space, from which nothing, not even light, can escape, our contemporary cultural landscape contains numerous intellectual black-holes-belief systems constructed in such a way that unwary passers-by can similarly find themselves drawn in. While such self-sealing bubbles of belief will most easily trap the gullible or poorly educated, even the most intelligent and educated of us are potentially vulnerable. Some of the world&#39;s greatest thinkers have fallen in, never to escape. This witty, insightful critique will help immunize readers against the wiles of cultists, religious and political zealots, conspiracy theorists, promoters of flaky alternative medicines, and others by clearly setting out the tricks of the trade by which such insidious belief systems are created and maintained.</p><p><b>Stephen Law </b>(Oxford, England) is a senior lecturer in philosophy at Heythrop College, University of London; provost for the Centre for Inquiry UK; and the editor of <i>Think: Philosophy for Everyone</i> (a journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy). He is the author of numerous books for adults as well as children, including <i>The Greatest Philosophers, Companion Guide to Philosophy, The War for Children&#x2019;s Minds</i>, and <i>Really, Really Big Questions</i>, among other works.A philosophy professor at the University of London, Law describes eight "intellectual black holes," traps that seem to lend credence to scientifically or rationally incorrect propositions. Recognizing such black holes as "playing the mystery card" (e.g., arguing that science can tell us whether ghosts exist) will help readers identify and critique illogical arguments. One particularly interesting concept is the "blunderbuss," which cites real but irrelevant illogical elements of, say, certain New Age beliefs. Another concept is what philosopher Daniel Dennett once called a "deepity," which Law defines as "saying something with two meanings"&#x2014;one true but trivial, the other false but seemingly profound. Law shows how these and other verbal sleights of hand are used in a wide variety of belief systems, including the paranormal, homeopathy, Christian Science, and belief in UFOs. Law includes an entertaining appendix of fictional letters called, pace C.S. Lewis, the "Tapescrew Letters," which recapitulate his eight logical black holes. Though he writes clearly and persuasively, this is not a particularly easy read, but his subject is important and deserving of readers' attention. Illus. (Apr.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Starting with a ragtag group of high school cross country and track runners, Larsen set out on a decades-long quest to find the secret of running impossibly fast, for longer distances than anyone thought possible. Himself a former farm boy who fell into his track career by accident, Larsen worked through coaching high school, junior college, and college, coaxing talented runners away from more traditional sports as the running craze was in its infancy in the 60's and 70's. On the arid trails and windy roads of California, Larsen relentlessly sought the 'secret sauce' of speed and endurance that would catapult American running onto the national stage. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Running to the Edge</i> is a riveting account of Larsen's journey, and his quest to discover the unorthodox training secrets that would lead American runners (elite and recreational) to breakthroughs never imagined. <i>New York Times</i> Deputy Sports Editor Matthew Futterman interweaves the dramatic stories of Larsen's runners with a fascinating discourse of the science behind human running, as well as a personal running narrative that follows Futterman's own checkered love-affair with the sport. The result is a narrative that will speak to every runner, a story of Larsen's triumphs--from high school cross-country meets to the founding of the cult-favorite 70's running group, the Jamul Toads, from national championships to his long tenure as head coach at UCLA, and from the secret training regimen of world champion athletes like Larsen's prot�g�, American Meb Keflezighi, to victories at the New York and Boston Marathons as well as the Olympics. <i>Running to the Edge</i> is a page-turner . . . a relentless crusade to run faster, farther.</p><p>MATTHEW FUTTERMAN is Deputy Sports Editor of the <i>New York Times</i>. He has previously worked for <i>The Wall Street Journal, The Philadelphia Inquirer </i>and the <i>Star-Ledger </i>of New Jersey, where he was a part of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News in 2005. Like a lot of sportswriters, he is something of a frustrated athlete, who is still smarting from going 0-8 in singles his senior year at Union College. He blames a formerly weak psyche and sub-optimal serve. He grew up in Larchmont, New York, and graduated from Mamaroneck High School, Union College and Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. He also attended the creative writing program at the University of Arkansas. He lives in New York with his wife and children. In his spare time he runs marathons. He is not sure why.ONE<br><br>Bobcat<br><br>Central Minnesota, 1951<br><br>Bob Larsen can&#x2019;t remember a time when he didn&#x2019;t run.<br><br>During the first dozen years of his life, a life on the farm in the lake country of Minnesota, he runs because he has to. Here, much of Bob&#x2019;s life involves figuring out the fastest way to get from point&nbsp;A&#x2014;�his home in the woods&#x2014;�to point&nbsp;B. More often than not, he arrives at the same answer&#x2014;�running. He runs to school. He runs to his friends&#x2019; houses. He runs because his family&#x2019;s log cabin and farm are a two-�mile trek on a narrow lane to the closest road. That road is a dirt road. So is the 15-�mile route to Detroit Lakes, the closest town. Down that road is the rest of the world&#x2014;�school, and friends, the closest stores, none of which are very close at all.<br><br>The nearest friends are three miles away. His one-�room school, with one teacher for all eight grades, heated with a wood stove, is two and a half miles from the cabin. A general store is even farther. When Bob is nine, his mother teaches school a few miles into the hinterlands. She brings Bob and his sister, LaDonna, with her in the family coupe. On the way, they pick up a few Native American kids from the White Earth Reservation who only rarely attended school in the past. They are older and bigger than Bob and LaDonna but in the same grade. Everyone wedges into the coupe and bounces along the dirt road to the schoolhouse.<br><br>At recess, the children run through the woods playing cowboys and Indians, climbing trees and hiding in the branches, covering long distances by moving as quickly as they can, then trekking back when the school bell rings. Bob almost always chooses to be an Indian. The Native American kids usually play the cowboys. They chase each other all around the land near the school. No one can catch Bob.<br><br>The next year Bob and LaDonna return to their regular school. In the afternoons, they often hustle home on a shortcut through the woods along the shores of the lake and streams on the edge of the neighboring game refuge. There are deer and foxes and turtles. If they get hungry they stop to pick wild berries and chokecherries.<br><br>Their farm is roughly 600 acres, with decent farming conditions, though not as good as the pricier land farther to the south. The soil is rich, and there are wide, level expanses. Half the land remains wooded, but there is still plenty of space to grow alfalfa, corn, and wheat every summer, and occasionally potatoes and other crops. Bob&#x2019;s mother has a large vegetable garden. In the fall, she cans the vegetables so her family can eat them through the long winter. They raise cattle&#x2014;�milk cows and calves, bulls and steers. They also have pigs, sheep, chickens, and a few turkeys kicking around. One gets slaughtered for Thanksgiving, another a few weeks later for Christmas. They have horses to ride and horses to plow. Bob owns a horse. He pays $90 of his own money for it, money he earned selling baby pigs at the county fair. With the exception of the milk cows, the number of animals they raise depends on the expected price of the meat at the market in Detroit Lakes, where they rent space in a freezer, store some of their meat for sale and some for personal use. On the farm all they have is an icebox. They cut the ice for the icebox out of the lake using hand saws during the winter. The plow horses pull the ice cakes onto the shore and up to the barn. They cover the ice with sawdust, which keeps it for the summer.<br><br>When Bob was young he helped milk the cows by hand twice a day. Eventually, his family gets a milking machine. They drink this milk, raw. It is rich and thick. So is the butter they churn from it, and the ice cream his grandfather makes with the hand crank during the summer.<br><br>Their cabin sits about thirty meters from Buffalo Lake, which is almost entirely surrounded by woods, creating an intense sense of a family alone in the wilderness. There is also a pond in the middle of the property. Run to the other side of the farm and the shoreline of another lake appears. Minnesota.<br><br>Bob runs to get from the cabin to the barn, to round up the cows for milking twice a day. He runs to get to the fields, and sometimes to go into the woods to explore and to find wild berries. Every day he shovels manure, and during the winter, snow. Muscles take root in his upper back. When he was eight years old, he learned to drive the team of horses pulling a wagon or a sled. None of this is easy, but it is the only life he knows&#x2014;�all farm kids do this sort of physical work daily, the kind that pushes them to the edge of exhaustion. And there is a payoff. They get strong from it. The strength makes them confident, and when they are challenged they believe they will have an advantage over kids who don&#x2019;t grow up on farms.<br><br>For Bob Larsen, this sense of physical superiority drawn from hard work will never go away. He will learn how to use it for himself and to pass it down to runners he turns into champions. He will feel it when he runs with the bulls in Pamplona. He understands bulls, he understands work, he understands self-�reliance, and he understands how to move quickly using only the power of his legs.<br><br>He doesn&#x2019;t yet know how important these ideas will be to a truth that he will spend a lifetime searching for, or that he will come as close as anyone to finding it. He doesn&#x2019;t know that he will understand the secrets to the East African domination of long distance running before even the Kenyans and Ethiopians do. He doesn&#x2019;t know that he will write the blueprints of training for an activity that will become a worldwide movement, and he will impart this knowledge to two generations of star long distance runners, that they will include collegiate and national champions and Olympic medalists, that one of them will pull off perhaps the most inspirational triumph in distance running history, and that he will do all this in relative obscurity during the next half century.<br><br>For now, Bob Larsen is still on a remote farm in the middle of Minnesota, happy as can be, until suddenly it all ends. Life on the farm comes to an abrupt completion on a spring afternoon in 1951 with a freak accident. Bob&#x2019;s father falls out of the haymow on the second floor of the barn. It&#x2019;s one of those hazards that make farm life among the most dangerous existences on the planet.<br><br>His father&#x2019;s injuries aren&#x2019;t fatal, but his back is wrecked, not catastrophically, but the farming days are over. There is simply no way to haul bales of hay or milk cows or drive the plow horses or drag the slop out to the pigs.<br><br>In the summer Bob&#x2019;s parents will head south and west. They will need money for the journey. Bob will collect the few hundred dollars he has earned through the sale of nine pigs birthed by the sow his father had given to him. He will give it to his parents. They promise to pay him back. Then they leave. Bob and his sister stay behind in Minnesota with their grandmother until his parents figure out where they are going to end up. They pause in Las Vegas to consider making a life in the desert. It is 104 degrees in the shade. They push on to San Diego, where a new life, warmer than Minnesota, cooler than Las Vegas, begins.<br><br>San Diego, Fall 1954<br><br>There are moments when the boy from northern Minnesota does not like high school, when he misses the family farm and the one-�room schoolhouse, the simplicity of life far, far away from the big city. He misses the horses and the cows, even the smelly chickens and all the work the farm required. There are times when he feels alone. These people out here on the coast of southern California he has gotten to know the past few years are a little different, which could make any teenager slightly uncomfortable.<br><br>Then there is gym class. Gym class has always been the time when he runs. In junior high school, these were dashes, 50 yards, 100, maybe 300 at most. The teacher lined the boys up in the schoolyard. A track was chalked off on the concrete. Bob Larsen took his spot at the front and felt no discomfort at all. He knew the boys around him would give him a chase, maybe finish within a few yards or even closer some days when he wasn&#x2019;t feeling his best, but almost always he would hit the finish line first. He likes to hit the finish line first. When he runs he is at home, even through middle school, when no one ever feels at home.<br><br>Now he is in tenth-�grade gym class, his first at this dizzyingly large institution with 3,000 students called Hoover High School. A teacher named Raleigh Holt, is lining the boys up for another one of these runs. He tells the boys that since they are in high school, they must run longer than they did before. This test, and it is a test, because Raleigh Holt needs it to be for reasons that will soon become clear to Bob, stretches 660 yards. They will need to be fast, but this 660-�yard run is also about being strong, Mr. Holt says. Larsen stands at the front, as usual. His strawberry blond hair is cut in a 1950s buzz. His eyes are bright and wide, focused, like they always are when he is about to run. The expression on his face is blank. Inside, where no one can see, he can feel the grin begin to emerge, because he knows what is going to happen next.<br><br>When he first arrived in San Diego, Bob joined a fitness program at the local YMCA. It was not far from his house, northeast of downtown in a neighborhood called North Park. After the farm, nothing felt far away. They did sprints and shuttle runs up and down and across the gym floor, the rubber on the bottom of their shoes squeaking with every twist and turn. They did sit-�ups and push-�ups and pull-�ups and chin-�ups. It was tiring for some, but Bob didn&#x2019;t really get tired. He does not tire the way the other kids do.<br><br>And now he knows he isn&#x2019;t going to get tired on this 660-�yard run his gym teacher, Mr. Holt, is describing like a trek to the Mexican border. Bob hears the boys around him moaning. He thinks about the farm, of all those runs through the woods and across the property. They were so much longer than 660 yards. Weren&#x2019;t they?<br><br>Yes, they were. Bob knows how this will go. He knows what it&#x2019;s like to work to the edge of exhaustion. He knows that work is the reason there will be so much daylight between him and the other kids after they leave the starting line. They will get tired. He will not.<br><br>For a moment, when Mr. Holt is done speaking, the gym teacher stands silently in front of Bob. When the whistle blows Bob will sprint to the lead, the air coursing through that strawberry blond buzz. He will never look back. He won&#x2019;t have to, because he knows who surrounds him&#x2014;�a bunch of kids from the city, and he knows they don&#x2019;t have a prayer of keeping up with him. By the end, roughly 100&nbsp;seconds later, his nearest classmate is 30 yards behind.<br><br>When gym class is over, Mr. Holt strolls over to Bob. He knows the boy isn&#x2019;t from here. He also knows he is going to turn Bob into one of the stars of the Hoover High School track team and one of the top runners in San Diego. He is fast. He just needs a little work.<br><br>Before very long, for the first time, Bob begins to train. Like the racing in gym class, the training comes fairly easily. In this unenlightened era, unless you are a sprinter, there is little variation. Like everyone else who is remotely connected to running, Mr. Holt knows about the regimens the great Czech runner Emil Z�topek put himself through on the way to winning the 5,000-� and 10,000-�meter races and the marathon at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952. In training, Z�topek rarely runs any distance longer than a half mile at a time. Occasionally he might go as far as a kilometer, or 1,200&nbsp;meters. Rarely though. But he does these repetitions over and over. A morning session and an afternoon one. He will do ten 880s, with a brief rest between each one, or twenty 440s, at a pace far faster than what he will race at in those long distance competitions. His competitors are in awe of these. They listen to Z�topek speak of running twenty 440s in succession, each one faster than 65&nbsp;seconds. Their legs begin to burn. It&#x2019;s not possible, they think. They are right. For them it is not.<br><br>Holt has adapted these workouts for his Hoover High School students&#x2014;�in other words, he has made them significantly easier. Monday through Wednesday the routine is almost always the same. The boys (it is all boys, because there is no girls team) run three 1,320s&#x2014;�three laps around the dirt track&#x2014;�with a solid 5 or 10&nbsp;minutes of rest between each one. Then they run eight 440s. Between each quarter mile, they walk a full lap of the track, which takes about five minutes. On Thursdays they &#x201c;jog,&#x201d; though they call it easy or light running, because almost no one in the U.S. has heard of the concept of &#x201c;jogging&#x201d; and won&#x2019;t for nearly another ten years. Fridays they race at track meets. They are expressly told not to run on weekends. Best to rest up for the next week. Same goes for summer. No running then. Summers are for recovery.<br><br>Thanks to a collection of very fast boys at the high school, it seems to work. Bob becomes an essential part of a team that almost never loses, even though nearly every star runner on the team, including Bob, spends weeks on the injured list. It will force him to understand that in running health is just as essential as speed. He learns early on that all the talent in the world is worthless if you can&#x2019;t get to the starting line. Only later will he understand that the injuries he and his teammates are experiencing are likely the result of an imbalanced training regimen, of every runner on the team doing the same thing day after day, an endless stream of intervals around and around the hard dirt track in black leather running spikes. It&#x2019;s a valuable nugget that he will store away until he begins in earnest that quest for running truth.<br><br>Bob and the Hoover boys try not to think about the pain. They focus on their numbers. They are all breaking 4:30 in the mile. The best of them can get down around 4:20 on a good day. By the time they are done, everyone knows they are among the best runners in southern California. As a senior, Bob is the top miler in the city, a star recruit for San Diego State University, where he gets to consider the most important concept that any runner confronts&#x2014;�what comes next.<br><br>What comes next is an up-�and-�down year of adjusting to life as a college runner and battling injuries. At the first practice, Larsen and his teammates are sent out on a three-�mile warm-�up run on the grass at Aztec Stadium. On other days, they do a warm-�up run on the roads around the university. This is interesting and different, farther than Bob has ever run in one stretch. The grass feels good under his feet, especially since he is training in the thin leather racing flats that provide little cushion. Then it is back to the interval training on the track that he is too familiar with. All those quarter-�, half-�, and three-�quarter-�mile near-�sprints around a rock-�hard dirt oval. Three weeks into the season, his shins are shot. He shuts down for two weeks, then comes back, then another shut-�down. It goes like this all year, even into the spring, when the injuries grow especially frustrating because for the first time Bob is starting to feel genuinely fast.<br><br>San Diego, Su...</p><h2>A Century of Dishonor: The Classic Expos� of the Plight of the Native Americans</h2><p>Sharply critical of the United States government's cruelty toward Native Americans, this monumental study describes the maltreatment of Indians as far back as the American Revolution. Focusing on the Delaware and the Cheyenne, the text goes on to document and deplore the sufferings of the Sioux, Nez Perc�, Ponca, Winnebago, and Cherokee &#x2014; in the process revealing a succession of broken treaties, the government's forced removal of tribes from choice lands, and other examples of inhuman treatment of the nation's 300,000 Indians. Stirring and eloquently stated, <i>A Century of Dishonor</i> was written in the hope of righting the wrongs inflicted upon this nation's first inhabitants. Within a year following its publication (1881), the book helped create the powerful Indian Rights Association. Decades later, author and critic Allen Nevins described the volume as "one of the soundest and most exhaustive works" ever written about Indian rights. Still a valuable reference, this book will be welcomed by students, historians, and others interested in the plight of Native Americans.</p><p></p><h2>A Christmas to Remember</h2><p><strong>Curl up with this heartwarming Christmas collection!</strong><br><br><b>Jill Shalvis</b>, <i>Dream a Little Dream</i>: Melissa has kept every man at a safe distance-especially firefighter Ian, a sexy friend with sexy benefits.

They never let fear get in the way of a great idea. Leanne and Steve Ford share their secrets for how to turn dreams into reality.</strong></p><p>Leanne and Steve were middle-class kids growing up in Pittsburgh in the 80s and 90s. There was nothing particularly glamorous or unusual about their lives as kids. Leanne was a shy, stubborn child who lived a rich life in her own imagination. Steve was outdoorsy and offbeat and was bullied mercilessly at school for being different. Their parents, grounded in faith and always encouraging of both creativity and hard work, gave them the confidence and the encouragement they needed to pursue the often difficult creative life. Leanne&#x2019;s slogan as a child was, &#x201c;My name is Leanne. If I want to, I can.&#x201d;</p><p>Leanne studied clothing design and pulled gigs at fashion houses in New York and as a stylist to country music stars in Nashville before she found her true passion: interior design. Steve threw himself into kayaking and snowboarding and opening his own men&#x2019;s clothing store in Pittsburgh. And then their individual passions converged when Leanne asked Steve to help renovate her bathroom.

But what began as a cultural war of independence from Britain devolved into a battle among lexicographers, authors, scholars, and publishers, all vying for dictionary supremacy and shattering forever the dream of a unified American language.</p><p>The overwhelming questions in the dictionary wars involved which and whose English was truly American and whether a dictionary of English should attempt to be American at all, independent from Britain. Martin tells the human story of the intense rivalry between America&#x2019;s first lexicographers, Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester, who fought over who could best represent the soul and identity of American culture. Webster believed an American dictionary, like the American language, ought to be informed by the nation&#x2019;s republican principles, but Worcester thought that such language reforms were reckless and went too far. Their conflict continued beyond Webster&#x2019;s death, when the ambitious Merriam brothers acquired publishing rights to Webster&#x2019;s <i>American Dictionary</i> and launched their own language wars. From the beginning of the nineteenth century to the end of the Civil War, the dictionary wars also engaged America&#x2019;s colleges, libraries, newspapers, religious groups, and state legislatures at a pivotal historical moment that coincided with rising literacy and the print revolution.</p><p>Delving into the personal stories and national debates that arose from the conflicts surrounding America&#x2019;s first dictionaries, <i>The Dictionary Wars</i> examines the linguistic struggles that underpinned the founding and growth of a nation.</p></p><p>A lively history of the intense contests among lexicographers in the early nineteenth century to produce a definitive dicitonary of American English.<b>Peter Martin</b> is the author of numerous books, including the acclaimed biographies <i>Samuel Johnson</i><i> </i>and <i>A Life of James Boswell.</i> He has taught English literature in the United States and England and divides his time between West Sussex, England, and Spain.</p><h2>50% Off Murder (Good Buy Girls)</h2><p><b>By Jenn McKinlay, author of the Library Lover's mysteries and the Cupcake Bakery mysteries, writing as Josie Belle</b><br><br>Maggie Gerber-one of the founding members of the Good Buy Birls- loves her quiet life in St. Stanley, Virginia.

In that instant, the life I knew was destroyed. I vowed that one day I would be whole again. This is my story.&#x201d; <br><br>An impassioned, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful story of one woman&#x2019;s pursuit of justice, forgiveness, and healing. <br><br>When Shannon Moroney got married in October 2005, she had no idea that her happy life as a newlywed was about to come crashing down around her. One month after her wedding, a police officer arrived at her door to tell her that her husband, Jason, had been arrested and charged in the brutal assault and kidnapping of two women. In the aftermath of these crimes, Shannon dealt with a heavy burden of grief, the stress and publicity of a major criminal investigation, and the painful stigma of guilt by association, all while attempting to understand what had made Jason turn to such violence. <br><br>In this intimate and gripping journey into prisons, courtrooms, and the human heart, Shannon reveals the far-reaching impact of Jason&#x2019;s crimes and the agonizing choices faced by the loved ones of offenders. In so doing, she addresses the implicit dangers of a correctional system and a society that prioritize punishment over rehabilitation and victimhood over recovery.</p><p>Shannon Moroney was a high school teacher and counselor when her husband&#39;s violent crimes tore her life apart. She is now a volunteer with Leave Out ViolencE (LOVE) and a contributor to The Forgiveness Project. She lives in Toronto where she is remarried and the mother of twins.I was happily writing a thank-you card for a wedding gift when I heard the knock at my hotel room door. It was November 8, 2005, I was thirty years old, and my life was about to change forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was away from home, attending a school guidance counsellors&#x2019; conference. When I opened the door I expected to see my colleagues at the threshold, inviting me to breakfast. But instead, I saw what no one wants to see: the silhouette of a police uniform filling the frame. A colleague was standing behind him.<br>&nbsp;<br>My heart instantly filled with dread. Whatever news the officer was delivering, it was going to be bad.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are you Shannon Moroney?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>I nodded, fear blocking my throat.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was in Toronto, 150 kilometres away from my home in Peterborough. I thought of my dad and my brother first. As salesmen who worked in and around Toronto, they both drove a lot, and I pictured a car accident. Had one of them been hurt?<br>&nbsp;<br>Were they going to be okay?<br>&nbsp;<br>Seeming to read my mind, the officer said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here because someone has died or been in an accident. I&#x2019;m here about your husband. Are you Jason Staples&#x2019; wife?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His question flustered me at first. Today was my one-month wedding anniversary and I wasn&#x2019;t used to my title of &#x201c;wife&#x201d; yet. During the last few weeks, Jason had been meeting me at the front door when I got home from work, saying, &#x201c;Hello, <i>my wife.</i>&#x201d; Batting my eyelashes theatrically and pretending to blush, I would reply, &#x201c;Hello, <i>my husband.</i>&#x201d; Then we would giggle and hug, and I&#x2019;d step inside.<br>&nbsp;<br>I nodded again to the police officer, still unable to speak. <i>Yes, I am Jason Staples&#x2019; wife.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>He was holding a newspaper. Confused, I glanced down at it and tried to read the headlines, but it was upside down so I couldn&#x2019;t make out anything. I glanced back up at the officer. My colleague looked at me from over the officer&#x2019;s shoulder, his face full of concern.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do you want me to stay, Shannon?&#x201d; he asked gently.<br>&nbsp;<br>I shook my head. He was kind, but I didn&#x2019;t know him well. I didn&#x2019;t want to involve him in whatever I was about to find out. The officer stepped into my hotel room. The door closed behind him.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stood in front of me, still holding out the newspaper. I reached for it, again trying to scan the headlines.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing in this paper. I just picked it up from in front of your door.&#x201d; He put the newspaper on a nearby table.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here about your husband, Jason. He was arrested last night, charged with sexual assault.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I felt my body go numb. My mind began to race with questions: <i>What does he mean? There must be some mistake! </i>My mind clouded with confusion.<br>&nbsp;<br>The officer continued. &#x201c;I understand that your husband called the police himself.&#x201d; So there was no mistake.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What happened? Who did he . . . assault?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>The officer was from Toronto, not Peterborough, so he didn&#x2019;t know the details. He handed me a slip of paper with the phone number of the police station and said I should call right away and ask for Sergeant DiClemente. Then, quietly, he said, &#x201c;I think you better expect that it was &#x2018;full rape.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My stomach flipped. I felt like I was going to be sick. How was this possible? Desperation now pushed into my chest making it hard to breathe. I had to stay calm. <i>This can&#x2019;t be happening. </i>I turned away from the officer, walked over to the desk by the window and put my hand on the phone&#x2019;s receiver, terrified at the thought of what I would hear when I dialed that number.<br>&nbsp;<br>Less than two hours earlier, I had been lying in bed with day just breaking outside the hotel window. I was so happy&#x2014;a newlywed filled with satisfaction and eager anticipation. I closed my eyes and an image of a shiny silver bowl came to my mind, filled with all the people and experiences of my recent past&#x2014;my thirtieth birthday, our beautiful wedding on Thanksgiving weekend, and then a brief honeymoon at a cottage where Jason and I had lain in a hammock and daydreamed of our future and children. Everything had come together.<br>&nbsp;<br>Under the blankets, I reached my hands down and rested them on my belly. I imagined cells splitting and multiplying inside me. The night before, in our &#x201c;talk at ten&#x201d; ritual that we followed when one of us was away, I had told Jason I thought I might be pregnant. &#x201c;That would be great,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take a test when you get home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I promised him that though I was tempted to take the test immediately, I&#x2019;d wait until I was back so we could share the moment. The night before, I&#x2019;d also spoken with my friend Rachael who lived in Colorado. We&#x2019;d been close for years, ever since we lived in Ecuador as development workers in our early twenties. &#x201c;I think this is it,&#x201d; I had said to her. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m pregnant!&#x201d; Lying in bed at daybreak, I focused on what it would mean to become a mother.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was small, my mum explained to my siblings and me how we&#x2019;d started off as &#x201c;one speck,&#x201d; then become &#x201c;two specks, then four, then eight&#x201d; and so on, until her mental multiplication skills ran out. Delighted, we could always ask her how many specks we were at any given moment in our development: &#x201c;Mummy, just before I was born, how many specks was I?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She would pause, ponder for a moment, and then say something like, &#x201c;Let me see . . . I guess you were eight-hundred and ninety seven thousand, four-hundred and thirty-two specks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>We loved it. I loved it. I loved that she knew me when I was just one speck of life, and that she had loved me even then. Now, as a grown woman, picturing those beautiful little specks inside of me, I was already loving them with all of my heart. I wanted to be the same kind of mother as my own: caring, dedicated, strong.<br>&nbsp;<br>At seven o&#x2019;clock, I got out of bed, took a shower and dressed for the final day of the conference. Then I packed my bags so that I could check out of the hotel at lunch, put everything in the car, and leave immediately after the last workshop. I was eager to get home. Jason would be there, and we had planned a simple, celebratory dinner to mark our first month as husband and wife.<br>&nbsp;<br>At 8:00 a.m., I still had half an hour to spare before breakfast. I pulled out a package of cards and got to work writing thank-you notes for wedding gifts I&#x2019;d received from colleagues at the conference. The phone rang. It was a co-worker from the board of directors, calling from the lobby.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Shannon,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There is someone who wants to see you. Can you wait in your room? I&#x2019;m going to bring this person up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I replied, puzzled. Maybe it was a guidance counsellor from my old high school who wanted to say a surprise hello. But why wouldn&#x2019;t the person want me to come down? I had only a minute to wonder before I heard the fateful knock at my door.<br>My heart was pounding. In my hand I held the number of the sergeant in Peterborough. The officer remained in my hotel room, still standing by the door and looking at me solemnly. I dialed the number and waited.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;DiClemente speaking.&#x201d; The voice was loud and authoritative.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sergeant DiClemente, this is Shannon Moroney. I&#x2019;m Jason Staples&#x2019; wife.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Faces of Honor: Sex, Shame, and Violence in Colonial Latin America (Di�logos Series)</h2><p><p>A contemporary of Columbus noted "those crazy Spaniards have more regard for a bit of honor than for a thousand lives."

Not that there was anything unusual in his arrival - doctors came and went often enough. But this one was young. New to the profession, as well as the place. There was a brightness to him that made her eyes ache.<br><br> 'This is her? Mrs Bainbridge?' The Mrs was a nice touch. She could not remember the last time she'd been given a title. It played like a tune she could only just recall. He looked up from his notes, intent upon her. 'Mrs Bainbridge, my name is Dr Shepherd. I am here to help you. To make sure we are giving you the sufficient level of care.'<br><br> Care. She wanted to stand up from where she sat on the edge of the bed, take his arm and gently guide him to the door. This place was not for innocents. Next to the stocky, middle-aged hag of an attendant he looked so vibrant, so alive. The limewashed walls had not yet leeched the colour from his face or dulled the tone of his voice. In his eyes she saw the gleam of interest. This disturbed her more than the attendant's scowl.<br><br> 'Mrs Bainbridge? Do you understand?'<br><br> 'Told you.' The attendant sniffed. 'You'll get nothing from her.'<br><br> The doctor sighed. Tucking his papers under his arm, he came farther into her cell. 'That does happen. Often in cases of great distress. Sometimes the shock is so intense that it renders the patient unable to speak. It seems likely, does it not?'<br><br> They bubbled up, the words in her chest. Her ribs ached and her lips tingled with the force of them. But they were ghosts, echoes of things that had been. She would never experience them again.<br><br> He bent forwards so that his head was level with hers. She was acutely aware of his eyes, wide and unblinking behind his spectacles. Palest rings of mint green.<br><br> 'It can be cured. With time and patience. I have seen it done.'<br><br> The attendant sucked in a disapproving breath. 'Don't get close, doctor. She's a fierce one, all right. Spat in my face once.'<br><br> How steadily he watched her. He was close enough for her to smell him: carbolic soap, cloves. Memory flickered like a tinderbox. She refused to let the flint spark.<br><br> 'You do not wish to recall what happened to you. But you can talk. The smoke inhalation was by no means bad enough to render you mute.'<br><br> 'She won't talk, doctor. This one's no fool. Knows where they'll put her if she ain't in here.'<br><br> 'But she can write?' He looked about the room. 'Why is there nothing here for her to write with? Have you not tried to communicate with her?'<br><br> 'Wouldn't trust her with a pen.'<br><br> 'A slate then, and chalk. You will find them in my room.' He fished in his pocket and thrust a key at the attendant. 'Fetch them. Now, if you please.'<br><br> With a frown, the attendant took the key and shuffled out the door.<br><br> They were alone. She felt his eyes upon her - not hard but uncomfortable, like the tickle of an insect crawling over her leg.<br><br> 'Medicine is changing, Mrs Bainbridge. I am not a man who will give you electric shocks or plunge you into cold baths. I want to help.' He cocked his head. 'You must know that certain . . . accusations have been made against you. Some people suggest you should be moved to a more secure facility. Or that perhaps you do not belong in an asylum at all.'<br><br> Accusations. They never explained the basis of the charge, only called her a killer, and for a while she had lived up to the reputation: throwing cups; scratching the nurses. But now she had a room of her own and stronger medication, it was too much effort to act the part. She would rather sleep. Forget.<br><br> 'I am here to decide your fate. But in order to help you, I need you to help me. I need you to tell me what happened.'<br><br> As if he could understand. She had seen things beyond the comprehension of his small, scientific brain. Things he would deny were possible until they stole up beside him and pressed their worn, splintered hands against his.<br><br> A dimple appeared in his left cheek as he smiled. 'I see what you are thinking. Every patient says the same, that I won't believe them. I confess, there are many delusions here, but few are without foundation. Some experience has formed them. Even if it sounds extraordinary, I should like to hear it - what you think happened. Sometimes, the brain cannot cope with the information it has to process. It makes sense of trauma in odd ways. If I can hear what your mind tells you, I might be able to understand how it works.'<br><br> She smiled back. It was an unpleasant smile; the one that made the nurses edge away. He didn't flinch.<br><br> 'And perhaps we can turn your predicament to our advantage. When a trauma has occurred, it often helps the victim to write it down. In a detached way. As if it happened to someone else.' The door whined; the attendant had returned with the chalk and slate in hand. Dr Shepherd took them and reached towards the bed, offering the items like an olive branch. 'So then, Mrs Bainbridge. Will you try for me? Write something.'<br><br> Tentatively, she reached out and picked up the chalk. It sat strangely in her hand. After all this time, she could not remember how to begin. She pressed the tip to the slate and drew a vertical line. It squeaked - an awful, high-pitched squeal that set her teeth on edge. She panicked, pushed too hard. The end of the chalk snapped off.<br><br> 'I really do think a pencil would be easier for her. Look, she is not dangerous. She is simply trying to do as we ask.'<br><br> The attendant glared. 'On your head be it, doctor. I'll bring one later.'<br><br> She managed to scrape out some letters. They were faint, but she was afraid to use force again. Just visible on the slate was a shaky Hello.<br><br> Dr Shepherd rewarded her with another smile. 'That's it! Keep practising. Do you think you could build it up, Mrs Bainbridge, and do as I asked? Write down all you remember?'<br><br> As easy as that.<br><br> He was too young. Too fresh and full of hope to realise there would be times in his life he would want to erase - whole years of unbearable moments.<br><br> She had pushed them down so deep that she could only reach one or two. Enough to confirm she did not want the rest. Whenever she tried to think back, she saw them. Their awful faces barring the way to the past.<br><br> She used the cuff of her sleeve to wipe the slate clean and write again. Why?<br><br> He blinked behind his glasses. 'Well . . . Why do you think?'<br><br> Cure.<br><br> 'That's right.' The dimple appeared again. 'Imagine if we could cure you? Set you free of this hospital?'<br><br> God love him. No.<br><br> 'No? But . . . I do not understand.'<br><br> 'Told you, doctor,' said the attendant in her harsh, magpie voice. 'She did it, all right.'<br><br> She tucked her legs up and lay flat on the bed. Her head throbbed. She raised her hands to her scalp and gripped, trying to hold things in place. Bristles prickled from her shaved head. Hair growing, months passing, locked away.<br><br> How long had it been? A year, she supposed. She could ask them, write the question on the slate, but she feared to learn the truth.<br><br> Surely it was time for her medicine, time to deaden the world?<br><br> 'Mrs Bainbridge? Mrs Bainbridge, are you well?'<br><br> She kept her eyes shut. Enough, enough. Four words, and she had written too much.<br><br> 'Perhaps I have pushed her too hard for today,' he said. But still he hovered, an unsettling presence by her bed.<br><br> This was all wrong. Her mind was thawing.<br><br> Finally, she heard him straighten up. Keys jangled, a door creaked open.<br><br> 'Who next?'<br><br> The door closed and muffled their voices. Their words and steps petered away down the corridor.<br><br> She was alone, but the isolation did not comfort her as it used to. Noises that usually went unnoticed came painfully loud: the rattle of a lock, laughter far away.<br><br> Frantic, she buried her face beneath her pillow and tried to forget.<br><br> o<br><br> The truth. She could not stop thinking about it during the cold grey hours of silence.<br><br> They didn't get newspapers in the day room - at least, not when she had been allowed in there - but rumours had a way of seeping under doors and through cracks in the walls. Journalists' lies made it into the asylum long before she did. Ever since she awoke in this place, she had been given a new name: murderess.<br><br> Other patients, attendants, even the nurses when they thought no one could hear: they twisted their mouths and bared their teeth as they said it, ravenous. Murderess. As if they wanted to frighten her. Her.<br><br> It wasn't the injustice she loathed but the noise, its syllables hissing in her ears like - No.<br><br> She shifted in bed and hugged her goose-pimpled arms tight, trying to hold herself together. Until now she had been safe. Safe behind the walls, safe behind her silence, safe with the beautiful drugs that drowned out the past. But the new doctor . . . He was the clock signalling with a dread knell that her time was finished. Perhaps you do not belong in an asylum at all.<br><br> Panic spiralled in her chest.<br><br> Back again to the same three options. Say nothing and be presumed guilty. Destination: the gallows. Say nothing and, by some miracle, be acquitted. Destination: the cold, sharp world outside, no medicine to help her forget.<br><br> Only one choice remained - the truth. But what was that?<br><br> Gazing back to the past, the only faces she saw clearly were those of her parents. Around them, shadowy figures massed. Figures full of hate that had terrified her and twisted the course of her life.<br><br> But no one would believe that.<br><br> A full moon shone in silvery lines through the window at the top of the wall, touching her head. She lay there, watching it, when the thought came to her. In this place of misrule, everything was upside down. The truth was mad, beyond the realms of any healthy imagination. And that was why the truth was the only thing guaranteed to keep her under lock and key.<br><br> She slid from the bed onto the floor. It was cold and faintly sticky. No matter how many times they mopped it, the scent of piss hung in the air. She crouched down beside her bed, finally facing the bulky shadow across the room.<br><br> Dr Shepherd had ordered them to bring it: the first new item in an unchanging landscape. Just a desk. But it was another instrument to crack open the charnel house and exhume all she had buried.<br><br> With her pulse pounding in her neck, she crawled across the floor. Somehow she felt safer down low, crouched beneath it, looking up the notched legs. Wood. She shivered.<br><br> Surely there was no reason to be cautious here. Surely they could not take any piece of wood and . . . It wasn't possible. But then none of it was possible. None of it made the least bit of sense. Yet it had happened.<br><br> Slowly, she stood and surveyed the surface of the desk. Dr Shepherd had left all the implements out for her: paper and a thick, blunt-ended pencil.<br><br> She pulled a page towards her. In the gloom she saw a void of white, waiting for her words. She swallowed the pain in her throat. How could she relive it? How could she bring herself to do it to them, all over again?<br><br> She peered into the blank page, trying to see, somewhere in its vast expanse of nothing, that other woman from long ago.<br><br> the bridge, 1865<br><br> I am not dead.<br><br> Elsie recited the words as her carriage sluiced through country roads, churning up clods of mud. The wheels made a wet, sucking noise. I am not dead. But it was hard to believe, looking through the rain-spattered window at the ghost of her reflection: pale skin; cadaverous cheeks; curls eclipsed by black gauze.<br><br> Outside the sky was iron grey, the monotony broken only by crows. Mile after mile and the scenery did not change. Stubble fields, skeletal trees. They are burying me, she realised. They are burying me along with Rupert.<br><br> It wasn't meant to be like this. They should have been back in London by now; the house thrown open, spilling over with wine and candles. This season vivid dyes were in fashion. The salons would be awash with azuline, mauve, magenta and Paris green. She should be there at the centre of it: invited to every diamond-spangled party; hanging on the arm of the host in his striped waistcoat; the first lady escorted into the dining room. The new bride always went first.<br><br> But not a widow. A widow shied from the light and entombed herself with grief. She became a mermaid drowning in black cr pe, like the Queen. Elsie sighed and stared into the hollow reflection of her eyes. She must be a terrible wife, for she did not long for seclusion. Sitting in silence musing on Rupert's virtues wouldn't help her grief. Only distraction could do that. She wanted to attend the theatre, to ride up and down on the rattling omnibuses. She would rather be anywhere than alone in these bleak fields.<br><br> Well, not quite alone. Sarah sat hunched on the squabs opposite, poring over a battered leather volume. Her wide mouth moved as she read, whispering the words. Elsie despised her already. Those mud-brown, bovine eyes that held no spark of intelligence, the pinched cheekbones and the lanky hair that always dribbled out of her bonnet. She'd seen shop girls with more refinement.<br><br> 'She'll be company for you,' Rupert had promised. 'Just watch her while I'm down at The Bridge. Show her a few sights. The poor girl doesn't get out much.'<br><br> He wasn't exaggerating. His cousin Sarah ate, breathed and blinked - occasionally she read. That was it. There was no initiative, no yearning to better her position. She'd been content in her little rut as companion to a crippled old lady until the crone died.<br><br> As a good cousin, Rupert had taken her in. But it was Elsie who was stuck with her now.<br><br> Yellow, fan-shaped leaves came swooping down from the chestnut trees and landed on the roof of the carriage. Pat, pat. Earth upon the coffin.<br><br> Only another hour or two, and the sun would start to set.</p><h2>The Soul of Man Under Socialism and Selected Critical Prose (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Illuminating essays on philsophy, literature, soceity, and art by one of Ireland's greatest wits</b><br><br>Oscar Wilde&#x2014;witty raconteur, flamboyant hedonist, and self-destructive lover&#x2014;is most familiar as the author of brilliant comedies, including <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>, <i>An Ideal Husband</i>, and the decadent novel<i> The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>.

Instead, they contend that religion is a form of social identification that not only shapes our ideas about politics, but it also shapes the behavior of political elites and ordinary citizens, the interpretation of public laws, and the development of government programs. Ultimately, the authors show how religion plays a fascinating and crucial role in our nation&#x2019;s political process and in our culture at large.<br><br>The eighth edition of Religion and Politics in the United States has been fully updated to include the latest scholarship and coverage of the 2016 presidential election. It also features a new discussion of the religious right, center, and left, as well as the impact of religion on the fight for equality based on gender and sexual orientation. Additional student resources include all new discussion questions and further readings at the end of each chapter, as well as a companion website featuring self-quizzes.</p><p>Kenneth D.

I have long recommended it to undergraduate and graduate students, and to colleagues who want to better understand the relationship between religion and politics in the United States. Now a classic has gotten even better, with expanded coverage of religion and gender politics, and the politics of sexual diversity. I recommend this highly to political scientists, sociologists, historians, and anyone interested in the myriad ways that politics and religion influence one another.

On perhaps its most obvious, superficial level, it&#x2019;s a text full of beautiful, haunting, lyrical language and interconnected themes that wind in and out of each other to weave a coherent fabric of many strands. Under that surface, though, lives a veritable dissertation (with plenty of angles that the reader can research) on otherness and transgression, and in turn, on how what or who that is other, or what or who that transgresses, problematizes the existence of the one who observes.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Drunken Boat</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In poems traversing that canny valley between verse and prose, Shin draws on cinema, technology, mythology, sci fi, autobiography and folklore to unlock the titular emotion: the unbearableness of the labyrinth, the splendor of being a machine&#x2014;a hybrid, a replicant, an orphan.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;The Rumpus</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;From this investigation of cloning, cyborgs, surrogacy, and adoption, Shin weaves a narrative of language and history that represents a striking new way of understanding identity.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong><em>&#x2014;Lantern Review</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In a striking interweaving of poetry and essay, etymologies brush up against adoption certificates, and quotations jostle with myths. . . .

It&#x2019;s there that his fate will become forever entwined with the Forge&#x2019;s, as Henry, Henrietta and Allmon, each stake their future in Hellsmouth, a filly bred from champions that could win it all. Fueled by beauty and rage, lust and violence, <em>The Sport of Kings</em> concludes with an ending that is as adrenaline fueled as Hellsmouth&#x2019;s last turn at the Kentucky Derby. C.E.

She was slender, tall, and might have been attractive if her hair under the drab hat had not been pulled back into a tight knot, making her forehead too high. She was dressed in a severe black suit, a traveling costume without a bustle or any of the absurd embellishments that women were affecting in 1885. At first glance, she might have looked a little like one of those dreadful mission solicitors, the sour women who held out their tambourines, demanding donations for the poor. But she was too poised, too neatly groomed, and she did not have the self-righteous look of a salvation peddler. <br>Most decent women who found themselves alone in the precinct with its tobacco-stained floors, its cigar-fouled air, amid Denver&#x2019;s snouts and boosters and other lowlife, were timid, uneasy. They stood nervously, red-faced, eyes downcast, sometimes shaking, until one of the detectives looked up and asked what they wanted. But Beret held herself erect, businesslike, as she scanned the room, daring anyone to question her presence. The truth was, she was a little unnerved at being in a place that was so distasteful to her, knowing as she did how squalid police stations were, how corrupt the inmates on both sides of the law might be. But it couldn&#x2019;t be helped, Beret told herself. <br>&#x201c;Help you, miss?&#x201d; A policeman spoke up at last. <br>Beret was startled by the question and almost blanched at the way the man looked her over, but she had had long experience in holding herself together and didn&#x2019;t flinch. &#x201c;I am looking for Detective Sergeant Michael McCauley.&#x201d; Her voice was low and rather pleasant and had not one hint of her unease. <br>A man at a desk glanced up as the policeman waved Beret in his direction. Ignoring the stares from the other lawmen in the room as well as the reprobates, Beret walked quickly to the desk and said, &#x201c;Detective Sergeant McCauley.&#x201d; It was a statement, not a question. She had learned that was the best way to approach a policeman&#x2014;or almost anybody, for that matter. <br>She did not appear to be a miscreant or the wife of some poor scapegrace come to beg for leniency for her husband.

What can I do for you, miss?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come about the death of Lillie Osmundsen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re her mother?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Her sister.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry, ma&#x2019;am. The light&#x2019;s poor in here.&#x201d; <br>Beret did not respond. Ten years older than her sister, Beret was used to being taken for Lillie&#x2019;s mother. <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t have guessed you were sisters,&#x201d; Mick said, after an awkward silence. <br>&#x201c;You mean I am not a beauty like my sister.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t say that at all.&#x201d; His reply was too hearty. <br>&#x201c;Then I hope you are more observant when it comes to searching for my sister&#x2019;s killer. It is obvious by far to anyone with a brain that she is beautiful, and I am unremarkable even on my best day.&#x201d; She should not have been so touchy. Then she added, &#x201c; <i>Was</i> beautiful.&#x201d; <br>Beret&#x2019;s voice was strident, and Mick frowned. &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. I&#x2019;m real sorry she passed over.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. Thank you. I believe the term is &#x2018;murder.&#x2019;&#x201d; Beret had repeated the word over and over in her mind, but she found it difficult to say it out loud, and she bit her lip to keep it from quivering. What an awful thing to have to say about one&#x2019;s sister. <br>&#x201c;Murder,&#x201d; Mick repeated. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what it is, all right.&#x201d; <br>Beret felt her knees grow weak and asked, &#x201c;May I sit down?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Mick pulled a chair from a nearby desk and placed it beside his own. Both seated themselves. <br>They stared at each other until Mick broke the silence. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve come for your sister&#x2019;s effects, the judge has them. There wasn&#x2019;t much, a few trinkets. We had to break into her trunk because we couldn&#x2019;t find a key. That&#x2019;s when we learned her identity. I hoped there might be something there that&nbsp;&#x2026; well&nbsp;&#x2026; would have helped us, but there wasn&#x2019;t. Hettie Hamilton, she&#x2019;s the, uh, the&nbsp;&#x2026; owner&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The madam, you mean.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure, that&#x2019;s right, the madam. She said your sister had some diamond earrings that were missing. I guess you&#x2019;d like to have them if we find them.&#x201d; <br>Beret did not want the detective sergeant to think she was mercenary. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve not come here for diamond earrings.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Mick waited her out. <br>&#x201c;I came to ask what success you have had in finding the man who killed my&nbsp;&#x2026; my unfortunate sister.&#x201d; Beret took a deep breath and held it. <br>Mick nodded. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve sure been working on it. We&#x2019;re doing our best.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does that mean there&#x2019;s been no progress?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can rest easy that we&#x2019;ll leave no stone unturned&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Beret interrupted. &#x201c;My sister is dead, my only sister. I did not come here for platitudes. Nor do I wish to be coddled. I want to know if you are close to finding Lillie&#x2019;s killer. And if you are not, why not. You may speak plainly.&#x201d; She detested men who treated her like an imbecile. Such straightforwardness in a woman was not a redeeming quality in most men&#x2019;s eyes, but Beret did not care. Lillie had been the carefree one, the flirt, the one who drew men like cats to cream, just as Beret had always been drawn to her. <br>She wondered if the detective was competent or if he was simply some political appointee. He was nice looking, tall, with reddish-blond hair, not gone to fat from too much free food and drink like so many officers she had encountered. Most detectives were untrained, she knew, and their appointment was political. It was unlikely this man knew much about investigating serious crime. She stared at Mick until he looked away. <br>&#x201c;We have some ideas, men she might have known,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;And they are?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say just now.&#x201d; Mick looked at two men sitting nearby who were listening in on the conversation. He smirked and pointed with his chin at one of them. &#x201c;That pickpocket with the copper tried to lift the wallet of the Reverend Tom Uzzell, no less. He must be new in town or else he&#x2019;d have known that the Reverend Uzzell would have given him the money if he&#x2019;d asked but would come down hard on any poor thug who tried to steal it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I am not here to discuss pickpockets,&#x201d; Beret said, glancing around the room and taking in the stares, the silence as the policemen as well as the malefactors tried to determine her business in the station. &#x201c;I see that this is not a place conducive to conversation. Well, Detective, I have not had luncheon. Is there somewhere I can get a cup of coffee and a bowl of soup, a place where we can have a private conversation?&#x201d; <br>Mick pulled out his pocket watch as if to show he was pressed for time, but he nodded. He stood, and Beret let him take her elbow and propel her back through the room to the door. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a restaurant down the street, if you&#x2019;re not too choosy. The food isn&#x2019;t the best, but it&#x2019;s cheap.&#x201d; The two went up the stairs from the basement of City Hall, where the station was located, Beret raising her skirt to keep it away from the vermin and the wads of chewing tobacco that repelled even the rats. Out on the street, Mick pointed to a little caf� a few doors away. <br>&#x201c;I imagine you would rather have a drink, but I am not fond of coffee in saloons,&#x201d; Beret said, and Mick&#x2019;s mouth dropped in surprise. Beret saw that and smiled to herself. She did like shocking people&#x2014;sometimes, at any rate. She and Lillie had had that in common. She felt a stab of pain at the thought of her sister. <br>The two walked down Larimer Street, Denver&#x2019;s major thoroughfare, past an undertaker&#x2019;s parlor, a clothing store, a drugstore, without talking, until they reached the Parr Caf�. Mick opened the door, and Beret preceded him into the restaurant, glancing around the room at the wooden tables bare of any cloths, the mismatched chairs, at the black-and-white marble floor that was chipped and stained. She headed for a table in the back. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not much,&#x201d; apologized Mick. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve dined in far worse. Do you eat here often?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;I prefer the saloon lunches.&#x201d; <br>He&#x2019;d paid her back for her jibe, but Beret liked that. She wouldn&#x2019;t want to work with a policeman who felt he had to sugarcoat everything he said because she was a lady. She hoped they would get along. &#x201c;Well, have you eaten here often enough to recommend something?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Chili. But it will burn your tongue.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Chili, then,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And coffee. Will you join me, Detective? I am paying, of course.&#x201d; Beret was well aware that the policeman made eighty-five dollars a month, a hundred if he was lucky&#x2014;plus whatever he got on the take. <br>&#x201c;Chili gives me the heartburn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What a pity. I&#x2019;m rather fond of it myself, the hotter the better. Perhaps there is something else you would like.&#x201d; <br>After Mick ordered for Beret, asking for coffee and a piece of apple pie with a slice of cheese for himself, Beret put her hands on the table and looked directly at the detective. &#x201c;Now, perhaps you will tell me the circumstances of my sister&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d; Her voice was calm, but inside, her heart was churning. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a pretty picture.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t imagine murder ever is.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about your sister&#x2019;s life. Do you know about it, miss?&#x201d; <br>At that, Beret almost lost her composure. Tears came to her eyes, and she turned aside. Mick apparently had no handkerchief to offer, so he patted her hand, but she did not want his patronizing and snatched her hand away. &#x201c;You must forgive me. I&#x2019;ve no experience in this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I should hope not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I mean in the murder of my sister. I am all too familiar with death itself.&#x201d; <br>Mick waited for her to explain, but she didn&#x2019;t. She sat, self-absorbed, thinking it was a good thing she knew about the sordid life of the underworld. It would make dealing with Lillie&#x2019;s murder easier. But maybe not. Nothing could ease the tearing of her soul that her sister&#x2019;s death had brought. <br>The chili came, and she ate it as easily as if it were pudding. &#x201c;I know, Officer, that Lillie worked in a brothel,&#x201d; she said as she finished the chili and put down her spoon. <br>&#x201c;Not for very long, it seems, no more than three months.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does it matter how long? She was a prostitute.&#x201d; Beret blanched as she said the words out loud for the first time. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy for you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s not easy for me,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;How would you like to discover your own sister was a woman of the streets?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I only meant&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>Beret dismissed him with a wave of her hand. &#x201c;I apologize, Officer. My sister&#x2019;s choice of profession is not your fault.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, but it was someone&#x2019;s fault, and I&#x2019;d like to find out who was responsible. In my position, you get used to death, but there was something about Lillie&nbsp;&#x2026; that is, Miss Osmundsen&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, she had that effect on men, even in death, it seems.&#x201d; Oh yes, Beret thought. She did. <br>The sergeant ignored the implication and continued, &#x201c;Something about her makes me want to find her killer. She was so young.&#x201d; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;Do you know anything about your sister&#x2019;s murder?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know very little. In fact, my aunt and uncle hoped to keep the circumstances of Lillie&#x2019;s death from me. At first, they told me only that she had died. They didn&#x2019;t want me to come to Denver. They said everything had been taken care of, that I should grieve at home in New York.&#x201d; As she remembered the telegram, Beret sipped from her cup, ignoring the fact the coffee was stale and burned and not very warm. &#x201c;They were looking out for me, of course.&#x201d; She added to herself, As I did not look out for Lillie. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>She had found the telegram mixed in with the mail on the parlor table, had overlooked it until Maggie, the housekeeper, pointed it out, because Beret rarely received telegrams. Then she&#x2019;d snatched it up with a premonition that it held bad news. But then, telegrams always seemed to bring bad news. The message was brief, cryptic, and told her in as few words as possible that her sister, Lillie, had died suddenly. Her funeral was being held that very day. She would be buried in Riverside Cemetery, in a plot set aside for her aunt and uncle. Everything had been neatly handled, so there was no need for Beret to make the long train trip from New York to Denver. The aunt and uncle sent their condolences. The telegram was signed Judge and Mrs. John Stanton. <br>Beret&#x2019;s hands shook, and her eyes clouded as she walked to the telegraph office to wire back her response, her condolences, for after all, the Stantons had taken Lillie under their wing when Beret would have nothing to do with her. Lillie had fled to Denver after the sisters had had their falling-out. <br>As an afterthought, Beret asked the cause of death. Lillie had always been healthy, and Beret wondered if her sister had died in an accident. Her aunt and uncle were right that there was no reason for her to make the trip. The funeral was done with, and Lillie might as well sleep for eternity in the Stanton plot. Beret&#x2019;s traveling to Denver to grieve for her sister would be hypocritical. At least, that was what she told herself. The real reason she hadn&#x2019;t wanted to go was she did not know how to act in front of her aunt and uncle. Did they know about the rift between the sisters? Surely they did. Would they blame Beret? Would she have to reveal the details, to relive that awful time? After she thought it over, Beret realized her reaction was more about herself than about her sister. Lillie was dead, and that changed everything. <br>The news brought a wave of emotion to the young woman, conflicting emotions that she knew she would have to sort through in the following days in her methodical way. At first, she was overwhelmed by grief. She remembered Lillie as the angel-child she had been as a little girl, her golden curls and curious blue eyes, her sunny temperament, the child&#x2019;s grief when first their mother, Marta, and then their father, Henry, had died, and Beret, young as she was, had taken the responsibility of raising her. <br>And then Beret was angry, as she remembered Lillie in the last year, her sister&#x2019;s devilish betrayal, the hate that developed between them. Something about the telegram didn&#x2019;t sit right with Beret. It was wrong that Lillie was dead. The thing between them had not been settled. Beret had expected Lillie to repent, to beg forgiveness, and when she did, Beret would hold out her arms, because after all, wasn&#x2019;t the bond between sisters stronger than any other? But Lillie had died, leaving Beret&#x2019;s arms empty, the business between them unfinished. <br>Beret returned from the telegraph office but could not eat supper and had gone to bed, and to her surprise, she had put her face into her pillow and cried, cried first from loss and then from rage as she realized she would never be able to extract the remorse from Lillie that was due. <br>She slept poorly, going out at dawn and walking far downtown, along streets enveloped in a gray mist and smelling of animal droppings and cheap kerosene, walking carefully past the human refuse that was huddled against the buildings, ignoring the stench from the bodies and the ragged clothing. She watched a fetid pile of rags move. A woman slowly rose to her feet and took a step or two, then fell to the ground and curled back into a ball. A man in a soiled apron stood in the window of a restaurant, shucking oysters, for at that early hour, men were coming off work for their supper of beer and mollusks. Two newsboys fought over a street corner, the larger boy pushing the smaller one into the thoroughfare and stamping on his hat. She&#x2019;d gone to the boy who was sitting in the gutter crying out filthy words, and bought a penny paper from him, giving him a dime for it. The lad started to give her change, but Ber...</p><h2>Texas Bride (Night Riders, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>She's the one woman he could never have... </strong></p><p>Handsome and devilishly charming Owen Wheeler has always had a way with women, but the war has left him a changed man.

When I learned of this new term, I began strongly supporting the use of this newer term. I believe that people should be able to call themselves whatever they wish, and scholars should respect and acknowledge their change of terminology. I went on record early on in convincing other anthropologists to shift away from use of the word berdache and in favor of using Two-Spirit. Nevertheless, because this book continues to be sold with the use of berdache, many people have assumed that I am resisting the newer term. Nothing could be further from the truth. Unless continued sales of this book will justify the publication of a third revised edition in the future, it is not possible to rewrite what is already printed, Therefore, I urge readers of this book, as well as activists who are working to gain more respect for gender variance, mentally to substitute the term "Two-Spirit" in the place of "berdache" when reading this text. -- Walter L. Williams, Los Angeles, 2006</p><p>Walter L. Williams's excellent research has produced one of the most extensive studies of the berdache culture among Native Americans. Unlike the larger American society, Native Americans historically have respected, and in many tribal nations venerated, homosexuals. Williams explains the berdache as a custom, its social roles, and the berdache history, including its introduction to the European concept of sin and intolerance of sexual diversity. The word <i>berdache</i> applies almost exclusively to males, mainly because historical records only relate dealings with aboriginal males, but Williams also includes a chapter on female sexual diversity, using the word <i>amazon</i> to describe these often warriorlike women.Walter Williams received his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and taught American Indian Studies at UCLA, and as professor of anthropology, history, and gender studies, at the University of Southern California. He taught at Buddhist monasteries in Thailand, and was also Fulbright Research Professor at Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia.

While contemporary philosophers tend to refrain from raising ontological and ethical concerns with vegetal life, Michael Marder puts this life at the forefront of the current deconstruction of metaphysics. He identifies the existential features of plant behavior and the vegetal heritage of human thought so as to affirm the potential of vegetation to resist the logic of totalization and to exceed the narrow confines of instrumentality. Reconstructing the life of plants &#34;after metaphysics,&#34; Marder focuses on their unique temporality, freedom, and material knowledge or wisdom. In his formulation, &#34;plant-thinking&#34; is the non-cognitive, non-ideational, and non-imagistic mode of thinking proper to plants, as much as the process of bringing human thought itself back to its roots and rendering it plantlike.</p><p><p>SHORTLIST - 2014 Findlay Book Prize for Best Book of Metaphysics Published between 2010-13, the Metaphysical Society of America</p>Michael Marder (PhD, Philosophy, the New School) is IKERBASQUE Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of the Basque Country.

Fielding, founder of the Bow Street Runners police force, then recruits young Jeremy in his mission to fight London's most wicked crimes.</p><p>Bruce Alexander is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and non-fiction. The previous books in this series are <b>Blind Justice, Murder in Grub Street </b>(Named by <b>The New York Times Book Review</b> as a Notable Book in 1995), <b>Watery Grave, Person or Persons Unknown</b> (named by the <b>Chicago Tribune</b> as one of the best novels of 1997), <b>Jack, Knave and Fool</b>, and <b>Death of a Colonial</b>.Sir John Fielding, co-founder with his late half-brother Henry (author of Tom Jones) of the Bow Street Runners, has been dead for 200 years, but he's just now getting his first starring role in a detective story. Here, in 1768, the blind magistrate rescues orphaned printer's apprentice Jeremy Proctor from a trumped-up robbery charge just in time to take Jeremy along as his youthful Watson while he investigates the apparent suicide of Lord Richard Goodhope, shot inside a locked library. Surprises abound, even for the seasoned Sir John: Lord Goodhope, who was on distant terms with his wife, died of poison, not his gunshot; the library is not quite so hermetically sealed as it appears; notorious gambler Black Jack Bilbo claims to hold Goodhope's markers for &#x153;12,000; one of his footmen left Goodhope's employ very recently, only to turn up in quite another connection. Even Mary Deemey, the invincibly English dressmaker who supplied widow's weeds to Goodhope's current actress companion, is masquerading as one Mlle. Claudette. But though he constantly has to ask Jeremy to describe things and places and people for him, nothing fools Sir John, and his clever identification of a suspect sets the stage for an old-fashioned denouement in the Goodhope library. Pseudonymous Alexander's debut wraps a competent mystery in a historical narrative of vivacity and charm. The final paragraph promises a sequel, perhaps a series. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

I. Warshawski Novel</h2><p>The bestselling V.I. Warshawski novels have dazzled readers and earned the acclaim of critics everywhere. &#x201c;V.I. Warshawski rules,&#x201d; writes <i>Newsweek,</i> crowning her &#x201c;the most engaging woman in detective fiction.&#x201d; Of V.I.&#x2019;s creator, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> says &#x201c;Sara Paretsky has no peer.&#x201d; <br><br>Now Paretsky brings her incomparable storytelling brilliance to her most powerful Warshawski novel yet. <b>Total Recall</b> follows the Chicago P.I. on a road that winds back more than fifty years &#x2014; and into an intricate maze of wartime lies, heartbreaking secrets, and harrowing retribution.<br> <br>For V.I., the journey begins with a national conference in downtown Chicago, where angry protesters are calling for the recovery of Holocaust assets. Replayed on the evening news is the scene of a slight man who has stood up at the conference to tell an astonishing story of a childhood shattered by the Holocaust &#x2014; a story that has devastating consequences for V.I.&#x2019;s cherished friend and mentor, Lotty Herschel.<br> <br>Lotty was a girl of nine when she emigrated from Austria to England, one of a group of children wrenched from their parents and saved from the Nazi terror just before the war broke out. Now stunningly &#x2014; impossibly &#x2014; it appears that someone from that long-lost past may have returned. <br><br>With the help of a recovered-memory therapist, Paul Radbuka has recently learned his true identity. But is he who he claims to be? Or is he a cunning impostor who has usurped someone else&#x2019;s history ... a history Lotty has tried to forget for over fifty years?<br><br>As a frightened V.I. watches her friend unravel, she sets out to help in the only way she can: by investigating Radbuka&#x2019;s past. Already working on a difficult case for a poor family cheated of their life insurance, she tries to balance Lotty&#x2019;s needs with her client&#x2019;s, only to find that both are spiraling into a whirlpool of international crime that stretches from Switzerland and Germany to Chicago&#x2019;s South Side. <br><br>As the atrocities of the past reach out to engulf the living, V.I. struggles to decide whose memories of a terrible war she can trust, and moves closer to a chilling realization of the truth &#x2014; a truth that almost destroys her oldest friend.<br><br>With fierce emotional power, Sara Paretsky has woven a gripping and morally complex novel of crime and punishment, memory and illusion. Destined to become a suspense classic, <b>Total Recall</b> proves once again the daring and compelling genius of Sara Paretsky.</p><p>Chicago private investigator V.I. Warshawski returns in an exceptionally well-plotted thriller that focuses attention on V.I.'s longtime friend Lotty Herschel. In a handful of chapters that punctuate the contemporary narrative, the Austrian-born physician tells her own story. More than just a device to draw the many threads of this complex novel together, Lotty's history illuminates the depth and complexity of a character that readers of Sara Paretsky's many books-- like V.I. herself--only thought they knew.<p> At a conference on the recovery of Holocaust assets, a man named Paul Radbuka surfaces, claiming to be part of the past that Lotty left buried in war-torn Europe half a century ago. The aging Lotty is emotionally shattered. She has never talked to V.I. about those years following her escape from Austria--her youth as an orphaned teenager in England and the brilliant medical career that ultimately brought her to America. But Radbuka's claims have such a dramatic effect on her that V.I. feels compelled to investigate him. Radbuka's early life in a concentration camp has recently come back to him, aided by the ministrations of a recovered-memory therapist. Now he's demanding that Lotty and her friend Max, another �migr�, acknowledge his connection to them, something neither is prepared to do. Is Radbuka really who he claims to be? And if he's the impostor Lotty says he is, why is she so terrified of him?</p><p> V.I.'s efforts to pin down Radbuka's identity dovetail with another case, that of a client with a beef against an insurance company that's trying to keep the state legislature from passing a Holocaust Asset Recovery Act. It's a little too tidy for coincidence, but since it gives Paretsky a chance to show off her knowledge of Chicago politics, the reader is delighted to accept it. While it's Lotty's voice that brings the dead to life and the past into the present, it's V.I.'s dogged perseverance and abiding affection for her friend that drive this powerful, brilliantly executed novel to a conclusion. This is one of Paretsky's strongest outings in years. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>&#x201c;[A] master of the mystery format, Paretsky skillfully expands the form to tackle several convergent themes in a moving novel of discovery and redemption.... Dark, absorbing, probing &#x2014; Paretsky&#x2019;s novel explores the complex web of degrees of guilt and complicity surrounding the fate of Holocaust victims and survivors, with Lotty&#x2019;s story emerging with compelling, terrible clarity and inevitability.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br></p><h2>A Boy of Old Prague (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>To feed his starving family, a young serf steals a chicken from his master's kitchen. Caught, his death sentence is commuted to servitude in the Jewish ghetto. The youth, Tom�s, trembles at the thought of being bound to a mortal enemy. Once settled among a moneylender's family, however, he discovers greater friendship and kindness than he has ever known. But can Tom�s protect his new friends from the injustices of his old world? Especially appropriate for 9- to 12-year-olds, this fable of tolerance vividly portrays Jewish ghetto life in sixteenth-century Prague. Twenty distinctive illustrations by famed artist Ben Shahn illuminate the text.

Educators, Jewish study groups, and other educational organizations will find it an excellent addition to their reading lists; general readers will find it inspirational as well.

Can it become a real career?</b> </blockquote> In recent years the role of homemaking has been somewhat derided and diminished in relation to careers outside the home. Furthermore, women are urged to return to the workplace as quickly as possible following childbirth. Homemaking is not generally viewed as real work, while daycare centers and childcare workers fill the gap. <br><br> The author maintains that the old understanding of the homemaking role needs to be reenlivened with spiritual knowledge. We can, for example, begin to work with the suprasensory aspects of the household, the etheric and astral qualities there, as well as the various spiritual beings that are connected with the home. <br><br> This book provides a generous helping of advice and ideas to help all those whose destiny is to develop a career that involves caring for home and family. It offers recognition of the dignity and importance of creating an environment that protects and nurtures children, preparing them for the larger world.</p><p><b>Manfred Schmidt-Brabant</b> was born in Berlin in 1926.

This was the key to her long-lasting appeal: she had an uncanny ability to play to an audience.

Sital grew up idolizing her grandfather, a wealthy Hindu landowner. Years later, to escape crime and economic stagnation on the island, the family resettled in New Jersey, where Krystal&#x2019;s mother works as a nanny, and the warmth of Trinidad seems a pretty yet distant memory. But when her grandfather lapses into a coma after a fall at home, the women he has terrorized for decades begin to speak, and a brutal past comes to light.</p><p>In the lyrical patois of her mother and grandmother, Krystal learns the long-held secrets of their family&#x2019;s past, and what it took for her foremothers to survive and find strength in themselves. The relief of sharing their stories draws the three women closer, the music of their voices and care for one another easing the pain of memory.</p><p>Violence, a rigid ethnic and racial caste system, and a tolerance of domestic abuse&#x2015;the harsh legacies of plantation slavery&#x2015;permeate the history of Trinidad. On the island&#x2019;s plantations, in its growing cities, and in the family&#x2019;s new home in America, <em>Secrets We Kept</em> tells a story of ambition and cruelty, endurance and love, and most of all, the bonds among women and between generations that help them find peace with the past.</p></p><p><strong>Krystal A. Sital</strong> was born in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and moved to the United States in 1999. A PEN Award finalist and Hertog fellow, she holds an MFA from Hunter College. Her work has appeared in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Salon</em>, <em>Today's Parent</em>, the <em>Margins</em>, the <em>Caribbean Writer</em>, <em>Brain Child</em>, and elsewhere. She lives in New Jersey with her husband and two daughters.&#x201c;One reads Sital&#x2019;s story appalled and moved by the suffering of these indomitable women...A reader can only applaud the author who has so skillfully preserved them in such loving, precise detail.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sheila Kohler, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is a striking book. And the strength, bravery and sheer will of the women will make you glad you read it&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lucy Kogler, <em>Lit Hub</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this stunning, unforgettable memoir, Krystal Sital writes with unflinching honesty, exploring with great depth and complexity her grandmother's liberation after her grandfather's death and the complications that arise from this fiery matriarch's quest to selfhood after years of abuse and servitude. A brilliant account of gender inequality and the burdens we bear as women in the Caribbean.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nicole Dennis-Benn, author of <em>Here Comes the Sun</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Once a decade or so, if we're fortunate, comes a book that seems to insist itself into being, on that rises from the heartbreakingly silent depths of the voiceless. <em>Secrets We Kept</em> is that book. It is a love song to the author's Trinidadian mother and grandmother, yes, but it is also a hymn of justice to the ignored and forgotten wounds of enduring and resilient women throughout the ages. It is a tribute to truth in the face of denial. It is a deeply resonant, timely, and necessary work of art.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andre Dubus III, author of <em>Gone So Long</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Powerful and heart-wrenching, Krystal Sital's beautifully written memoir, <em>Secrets We Kept</em>, details her family history on Trinidad, as her grandmother and mother finally unleash their voices to uncover the brutal truth of who her grandfather truly was.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jean Kwok, author of <em>Mambo in Chinatown</em> and <em>Girl in Translation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Krystal A. Sital brings the generations of her family powerfully to life, rendering their struggles and determination with courage and compassion. I love how it is first the sense of voice that constitutes place; it means that the most vivid world I find myself in is the one inside each of Sital&#x2019;s family members, rendered with an honest, rigorous love.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tracy K. Smith, author of <em>Ordinary Light</em> and Poet Laureate of the United States</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Krystal A. Sital is no less than a ventriloquist, giving breath and voice to three generations of courageous Trinidadian women through bracing, evocative prose.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gaiutra Bahadur, author of the Orwell Prize-shortlisted <em>Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In luminous, aching prose, Krystal A. Sital summons a rich polyphony of voices, spanning generations. As these voices build and weave with dazzling intricacy across the years and the miles, they form a reckoning, a prayer, an unforgettable testament to the strength of women in response to violence, the myriad ways that they are able to remake the unspeakable into extraordinary acts of love. Sital's ability to look straight at the unspoken traumas of her family and give them voice, with both compassion and unsparing honesty, is the ultimate expression of love.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Inara Verzemnieks, author of <em>Among the Living and the Dead</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Intricate, searing, Krystal A. Sital&#x2019;s multi-generation tale draws from the true voices of the women in her family. Written in prose both gently loving and harrowing, she gives us their pain, their endurance&#x2015;and their ultimate strength. A remarkable feat of storytelling, a testament to the power of listening, and a crucial contribution to Caribbean literature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marina Budhos, author of <em>Watched</em> and <em>The Professor of Light</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Krystal A. Sital&#x2019;s <em>Secrets We Kept</em> is a masterful exploration of family history and hurt. With her grandfather unresponsive and close to death, Sital bears witness to her mother and grandmother&#x2019;s recollections of life in Trinidad with him and tries to reconcile two versions of this man: the gentle grandfather who played with her, and the tyrant who beat his wife, sister, and children. Secrets We Kept investigates storytelling itself and the gaps between a life lived and its different, at times clashing depictions. It should be required reading for students of creative nonfiction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeannie Vanasco, author of <em>The Glass Eye</em> and <em>Things We Didn't Talk About When I Was a Girl</em></strong></p><h2>Human Universe</h2><p><p><b><strong>Top ten <em>Sunday Times</em> Bestseller</strong></b></p><p><strong>&#x2018;Engaging, ambitious and creative&#x2019; <em>Guardian</em></strong></p><p><strong>Where are we?

His characters, almost all of who are first-generation Indian Americans, subvert our expectations that they will sit quietly by. We meet two brothers caught in an elaborate web of envy and loathing; a young gay man who becomes involved with an older man whose secret he could never guess; three women who almost gleefully throw off the pleasant agreeability society asks of them; and, in the final pair of linked stories, a young couple struggling against the devastating force of community gossip. <br><i></i><br><i>If You See Me, Don't Say Hi</i> examines the collisions of old world and new world, small town and big city, traditional beliefs (like arranged marriage) and modern rituals (like Facebook stalking). Ranging across the country, Patel&#x2019;s stories -- empathetic, provocative, twisting, and wryly funny -- introduce a bold new literary voice, one that feels more timely than ever.</p></p><p><b>Neel Patel</b> is a first-generation Indian American who grew up in Champaign, Illinois.

How else to explain these stories, full of terrible spouses, warring siblings, unapologetic liars, and naive kids, searching for happiness, love, or maybe just sex?

It is a guide to discovering and fulfilling our potential in life, relationships and work by following the &#34;code&#34;.</p><p>James Hillman, a former director of the Jung Institute who has written more than 20 books on behavior and psychology, delves into human development in <i>The Soul's Code</i>. Hillman encourages you to "grow down" into the earth, as an acorn does when it becomes a mighty oak tree. He argues that character and calling are the result of "the particularity you feel to be you" and knocks those who blame childhood difficulties for all their problems as adults. According to Hillman, "The current American identity as a victim is the flip side of the coin whose head brightly displays the opposite identity: the heroic self-made man, carving out destiny alone and with unflagging will." Hillman's theories seem disarmingly simple, but he backs them with a careful, well-practiced intellect.Some call it" genius". Others have named it "spirit", "daimon", and even "guardian angel". But while philosophers and psychologists from Plato to Jung emphasized the fundamental essence of our individuality, our modern culture refuses to accept that a unique, formed soul is within us from birth, shaping as much as it is shaped.<p>Now in this extraordinary bestseller, James Hillman presents a brilliant new vision of our selves not defined by family relationships or the mentality of victimization. Drawing on the biographies of such disparate people as Ella Fitzgerald and Mohandas K. Gandhi, James Hillman argues that character is fate and shows how the soul, if given the opportunity, can assert itself even at an early age. The result is a reasoned and powerful road map to understanding our true nature and discovering an eye-opening array of choices -- from the way we raise our children to our career paths to our social and personal commitments to achieving excellence in our time.</p></p><h2>The Rehearsals (Dedalus Europe)</h2><p>New Jerusalem Monastery, seventeenth-century Moscow. Patriarch Nikon has instructed an itinerant French dramatist to stage the New Testament and hasten the Second Coming. But this will be a strange form of theatre. The actors are untrained, illiterate Russian peasants, and nobody is allowed to play Christ. They are persecuted, arrested, displaced, and ultimately replaced by their own children. Yet the rehearsals continue... A stunning reflection on art, history, religion and national identity, Rehearsals is the seminal work in the unique oeuvre of Vladimir Sharov, Russian Booker Prize winner (2014) and author of Before &amp; During (Read Russia award for best translation, 2015).</p><p>Historian of late-medieval Russia by training Vladimir Sharov, born in 1952, first turned to fiction in the late 1970s. It was not until the 1990s, however, that his extraordinarily imaginative and daring novels come to the attention of the public. When they did, they caused acrimony and controversy.subsequently his novels have won all the major Russian literary prizes. Before and During in 2014 was his first novel to appear in English."The clarity and directness of Sharov's prose are disconcerting, almost hallucinatory. His writing is at times funny, at times so piercingly moving, so brimful of unassuaged sorrow, that it causes a double-take." -- Rachel Polonsky, NY Review of Books<br><br>"Oliver Read hears and renders into English many stylistic registers, reminding us that Sharov began creative life as a poet. If it is true &#x2015; and I believe it is &#x2015; that translation requires the most intimate dialogue possible with another&#x2019;s consciousness, then Sharov&#x2019;s rebirth into English in such staggeringly fine prose is the perfect tribute to commemorate the departure of his mortal body." -- Caryl Emerson in the Los Angeles Review of Books</p><h2>LAW AND MARXISM</h2><p>A classic Marxist study of jurisprudence theory from Marxist heavyweight.</p><p>Evgeny Pashukanis was born in 1891 of a Lithuanian family.

In Don't Get Too Comfortable, Rakoff journeys into the land of plenty that is contemporary North America. Rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly and wittily portrayed. <br>Whether contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good times and chicken wings of Hooters Air, portraying the rarified universe of Paris fashion shows where an evening dress can cost as much as four years of college, or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core Playboy TV shoot, where he is provided with his very own personal manservant, David Rakoff takes us on a bitingly funny grand tour of our culture of excess, delving into the manic getting and spending that defines the North American way of life. <br>Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism, and Rakoff is there to map that frontier. He sits through the grotesqueries of "avant garde" vaudeville in Times Square immediately following 9/11.

Historically important and emotionally resonant, these characters appeal to every class of follower. Metaphorically and rhetorically powerful, they invite constant reimagining across time. <br><br>Focusing on representations of the ghost and monk from the late eighteenth century to the present, Justin Thomas McDaniel builds a case for interpreting modern Thai Buddhist practice through the movements of these transformative figures. He follows embodiments of the ghost and monk in a variety of genres and media, including biography, film, television, drama, ritual, art, liturgy, and the Internet. Sourcing nuns, monks, laypeople, and royalty, he shows how relations with these figures have been instrumental in crafting histories and modernities. McDaniel is especially interested in local conceptions of being "Buddhist" and the formation and transmission of such identities across different venues and technologies. <br><br>Establishing an individual's "religious repertoire" as a valid category of study, McDaniel explores the performance of Buddhist thought and ritual through practices of magic, prognostication, image production, sacred protection, and deity and ghost worship, and clarifies the meaning of multiple cultural configurations. Listening to popular Thai Buddhist ghost stories, visiting crowded shrines and temples, he finds concepts of attachment, love, wealth, beauty, entertainment, graciousness, security, and nationalism all spring from engagement with the ghost and the monk and are as vital to the making of Thai Buddhism as venerating the Buddha himself.</p><p>Focusing on representations of a famous ghost and monk from the late eighteenth century to today, Justin Thomas McDaniel builds a case for interpreting modern Thai Buddhist practice through the movements of these transformative figures.

We think of rituals&#x2014;the patterned ways of doing things that have shared and often multiple meanings&#x2014; as being steeped in tradition and therefore unalterable. But rituals have always been reinvented. When we perform ancient rituals in a particular place and time they are no longer quite the same rituals they once were. Each is a debut, an innovation: this Sabbath meal, this Passover seder, this wedding&#x2014;firsts in their own unique ways. In the last 30 years there has been a surge of interest in reinventing ritual, in what is called minhag America. Ochs describes the range and diversity of interest in this Jewish American experience and examines how it reflects tradition as it revives Jewish culture and faith. And she shows us how to create our own ritual objects, sacred spaces, ceremonies, and liturgies that can be paths to greater personal connection with history and with holiness: baby-naming ceremonies for girls, divorce rituals, Shabbat practices, homemade haggadahs, ritual baths, healing services. Through these and more, we see that American Judaism is a dynamic cultural process very much open to change and a source of great personal and communal meaning.</p><p><br>The ceramic &#x201c;Tree of Life&#x201d; spice container that appears on the cover of <i>Inventing Jewish Ritual</i> is by Susan Garson of Garson and Pakele Studios, www.garsonpakele.com</p></p><p>Inventing Jewish Ritual was named the 2007 National Jewish Book Award Winner in the category of Contemporary Jewish Life and Practice.Inventing Jewish Ritual Vanessa L.

Levine had years earlier recognized Levis as "the most gifted and determined young poet I have ever had the good fortune to have in one of my classes"; after Levis's death, Levine edited the poems Levis had left behind. What emerged is this haunting collection, <i>Elegy</i>.<br> <br> The poems were written in the six years following publication of his previous book, <i>The Widening Spell of the Leaves</i>, and continue and extend the jazz improvisations on themes that gave those poems their resonance. There are poems of sudden stops and threats from the wild: an opossum halts traffic and snaps at pedestrians in posh west Los Angeles; a migrant worker falls victim to the bites of two beautiful black widow spiders; horses starve during a Russian famine; a thief, sitting in the rigging of Columbus&#x2019;s ship, contemplates his work in the New World. The collection culminates in the elegies written to a world in which culture fragments; in which the beasts of burden&#x2014;the horses, the migrant workers&#x2014;are worked toward death; a world in which "Love's an immigrant, it shows itself in its work. / It works for almost nothing"; a world in which "you were no longer permitted to know, / Or to decide for yourself, / Whether there was an angel inside you, or whether there wasn't."<br> <br> <i>Elegy</i>, as Levine says, was "written by one of our essential poets at the very height of his powers. His early death is a staggering loss for our poetry, but what he left is a major achievement that will enrich our lives."</p></p><p>Larry Levis was an outstanding poet, and a student and colleague of Philip Levine. Levine, who edited this posthumous manuscript, writes that Levis's "early death is a staggering loss for our poetry, but what he left is a major achievement that will enrich our lives for as long as poetry matters." That's high praise, and the poems in <i>Elegy</i> are sturdy enough to carry the weight of those expectations. Especially striking is "The Oldest Living Thing in L.A.," an encounter between urbanites trapped within the prisons of their routines, and an ancient-seeming possum crossing a busy city street: "It would lift its black lips &amp; show them / The reddened gums, the long rows of incisors, / Teeth that went all the way back beyond / The flames of Troy &amp; Carthage..." Levis's writing is marked by memorable imagery that resonates both to the world of our daily lives and our mythic longings for transcendence.A few days before his death in 1996, Larry Levis mentioned to his friend and former instructor Philip Levine that he had &#34;an all-but-completed manuscript&#34; of poems.

The art and poems do not explain one another, but rather engage in a kind of dialogue. "The longer I look at the pictures of Jan Peter Tripp," Sebald comments in his essay, "the better I understand that behind the illusions of the surface, a dread-inspiring depth is concealed.

Renan describes Jesus as a popular religious leader and self-proclaimed Messiah who increasingly advocated the overthrow of Roman rule and the establishment of a theocracy. To support his apocalyptic vision, Renan&#39;s Jesus was not above using trickery and deception, as in the raising of Lazarus. The impression left by Jesus on his disciples was so profound that they began to proclaim his Resurrection and presence among them shortly after his death. Even conceding Christ&#39;s historicity, it is still seriously debated by modern biblical scholars whether a reliable life of Jesus can be gleaned from the gospels. For this very reason, the questions raised by Renan a century ago about the facts surrounding Jesus&#39; life and the authorship of the gospels are still far from settled. The Life of Jesus has provoked both controversy and praise since its publication in 1863.</p><p><b>ERNEST RENAN</b>&nbsp;was born in Tr�guier, Brittany, on February 27, 1823. Following the death of his father five years later, Renan was left in the care of his older sister, Henriette, who saw to her brother's education and became his confidante and chief supporter until her death in 1861. Renan attended various Catholic seminaries, and even took minor orders; but in 1845, he promptly abandoned his priestly vocation as well as his Catholic faith. Thereafter, Renan would reject the claims of orthodox religion.<br><br>While still in the seminary, Renan displayed unusual brilliance in linguistics; in 1848, he won the Volney Prize for his <i>Essay on the Semitic Languages. </i>After receiving his doctoral degree, Renan was appointed professor of Hebrew at the College de France in 1862. But he used the occasion of his inaugural lecture to denounce Christ's divinity, and was promptly dismissed. Renan's teaching post was later restored to him, however.<br><br>Renan wrote extensively on early Christianity: his most famous work is <i>The Life of Jesus, </i>published in 1863. A profound analysis of the New Testament and other ancient accounts of Jesus' life, it depicts Christ as a simple teacher who became increasingly fanatical and deluded by his self-proclaimed Messianic purpose. The Resurrection, long cherished as the central mystery of Christianity, began his�torically as nothing more, Renan argues, than a rumor propagated by Christ's followers to keep the memory of their crucified leader alive. <i>The Life of Jesus, </i>while de�nounced by orthodox Christians, gained wide attention: more than 60,000 copies were sold within the first year of publication. <i>The Life of Jesus </i>was but one in a series of works collectively titled <i>The History of the Origins of Christianity </i>(1863-1881), whose main purpose was to show that the Christian religion was an outgrowth of human processes, not a divine purpose. Renan continued to publish and to teach at the Coll�ge de France; he later became administrator of the Coll�ge, and in 1878 was elected to the French Academy. Ernest Renan died in Paris on&nbsp;October 2, 1892.<br><br> Renan's other published works include: <i>The Apostles </i>(1866),<i>&nbsp;<i>The Christian Church</i></i> (1879)<i>, </i>and<i> <i>Marcus Aurelius and the End of the Ancient World </i></i>(1880)<i>.<br></i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Shooting Kabul</h2><p>Fadi never imagined he'd start middle school in Fremont, California, thousands of miles away from home in Kabul.&nbsp; But, here he was, half a world apart from his missing six year old sister who'd been lost because of him, as they'd fled Afghanistan. Adjusting to life in the United States isn't easy for Fadi's family and as the events of September 11th unfold, the prospects of locating Mariam in a war torn Afghanistan seem slim -- impossible. Desperate, Fadi tries every hare-brained scheme he can think of to find her. When a photography competition with a grand prize trip to India is announced, Fadi sees his chance to return to Afghanistan and find his sister.&nbsp; But can one photo really bring Mariam home?<br> Based in part on Ms. Senzai's husband's experience fleeing Soviet controlled Afghanistan in 1979, Shooting Kabul is a powerful story of hope, love, and perseverance.</p><p>N. H. Senzai is the author of the acclaimed&nbsp;<i>Shooting Kabul</i>, which was on numerous state award lists and an NPR Backseat Book Club Pick. Its companion,&nbsp;<i>Saving Kabul Corner</i>, was nominated for an Edgar Award. While her first two books are based in part on husband&#x2019;s experience fleeing Soviet-controlled Afghanistan in the 1970s, her third,&nbsp;<i>Ticket to India</i>&nbsp;is based on her own family&#x2019;s history.

Visit her online at NHSenzai.com.<i>IT&#x2019;S A PERFECT NIGHT to run away,</i> thought Fadi, casting a brooding look at the bright sheen of the moon through the cracked backseat window. It reminded him of the first line of the book <i>From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.</i><br><br>&#x201c;Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi was only halfway through the first chapter, so he didn&#x2019;t know how successful Claudia had been in her getaway, old-fashioned or not, but he sure hoped that his family would be. If they weren&#x2019;t, they were going to be in an awful lot of trouble.<br><br>Under the protective cover of darkness, the taxi he and his family were traveling in swerved around a bombed-out Soviet tank and exited the pockmarked highway. They needed to avoid the checkpoints set up by black-turbaned men on the main road. With the headlights turned off, the car careened over a rocky plain, rattling the passengers&#x2019; teeth. Fadi pressed his nose against the cold glass, peering across the desolate landscape.<br><br>His reflection flashed back, revealing a thin face with unruly dark hair escaping from beneath a traditional beaded cap. His nose sloped slightly to the left, evidence he&#x2019;d broken it once. He held his breath when the driver nearly hit a tree stump while plowing through a parched wheat field. Another mile and they arrived at the outskirts of the sprawling city of Jalalabad, in the eastern province of Afghanistan.<br><br>The driver slowed, weaving his way through narrow alleys toward the crumbling buildings that rose in the distance. They bypassed quiet residential neighborhoods and a shuttered local vegetable market. Finally, the brakes squeaked in protest and the taxi came to a lurching halt alongside a row of deserted warehouses. The concrete walls were riddled with bullet holes and grenade blasts.<br><br>&#x201c;Is this it?&#x201d; asked Fadi&#x2019;s father, leaning forward in the front seat.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Habib. We&#x2019;re on the corner of Jalalkot Road and Turi Street,&#x201d; replied the driver.<br><br>Habib peered at the corner, his lips compressed in a tight line.<br><br>&#x201c;As a boy I remember coming here with my father,&#x201d; added the driver with a heavy sigh. &#x201c;For generations the merchants here created beautiful handcrafted paper.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi took in the desolate junction, trying to imagine bustling streets, shops overflowing with stacks of gleaming paper, customers haggling over prices.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; said Habib, his voice quavering for a moment. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Fadi, snap out of it,&#x201d; whispered Noor, Fadi&#x2019;s older sister. She pushed open the door and stepped out first, followed gingerly by their mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Zafoona,&#x201d; said Habib, turning to his wife, &#x201c;are you all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Zafoona, her voice a thin whisper.<br><br>Noor took her mother&#x2019;s elbow and gently propelled her toward the side of the road.<br><br>Fadi emerged next, keeping a protective hand on his younger sister, Mariam, who slid out behind him. The faint moonlight provided just enough light to help guide them into the sheltered doorstep of a shuttered tea shop nearby. Noor and Fadi&#x2019;s mother stood enveloped in burkas, two smudges of light blue against the drab gray walls.<br><br>Fadi glanced back and saw his father push a wad of cash toward the frail white-haired taxi driver, who shook his head. After a heated whispered discussion the driver finally pocketed the money and opened the trunk so that Habib could pull out their meager belongings. Fadi eyed the two scuffed suitcases. Most of what they&#x2019;d owned&#x2014;the plush carpets, color television and video player, radios, jewelry, fine china, toys, clothes and even his mother&#x2019;s beloved books&#x2014;had been sold on the black market, or used as bribes to get their paperwork and passports in order.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Salaam Alaikum</i>, and good luck, Habib,&#x201d; whispered the driver. His eyes glanced nervously over the deserted, dusty street.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Walaikum A&#x2019;Salaam</i>, Professor Sahib, and thank you for risking your life to bring us here,&#x201d; replied Fadi&#x2019;s father with a grim smile.<br><br>&#x201c;How could I not?&#x201d; replied the driver. &#x201c;You were my best student in Kabul University,&#x201d; he added, cracking a tired smile.<br><br>&#x201c;That was a long, long time ago,&#x201d; said Habib, giving the man a fierce parting hug.<br><br>The family said their good-byes and watched as the taxi disappeared down the road, its broken taillight fading into the gloom.<br><br>Fadi peered down the empty street, trying to make out the words on the broken signs lying on the dusty pavement. ZAKARIA&#x2019;S PAPER EMPORIUM read one, while another claimed to have the finest writing vellum in all of Afghanistan.<br><br>The eerie stillness was broken by muffled coughing as Zafoona covered her mouth with a handkerchief. Before she could tuck it away, Fadi saw a trace of blood on the snowy white cloth.<br><br><i>She is getting worse,</i> he thought, worry creasing his forehead. He glanced at his father, who gave him an encouraging wink and gently squeezed his shoulder. Fadi smiled in return, but he could see the fear lingering in his father&#x2019;s eyes, fear coupled with determination. As a Pukhtun, his father was bound by the ancient, sacred code of Pukhtunwali to protect his <i>namus</i>&#x2014;the women of his family&#x2014;with his life. With a shiver Fadi recalled the moment, nearly six months before, when his father had revealed his plan.<br><br>It was a blustery day in January as the family sat together at breakfast, trying to keep warm under layers of clothing. Fadi&#x2019;s mother set down a plate of old bread she&#x2019;d reheated, along with chunks of white cheese, a rare treat.<br><br>&#x201c;Ooooh!&#x201d; said Mariam. Her hazel eyes sparkled as her fork inched closer to the plate. &#x201c;Something to go with boring old bread... . Come to me, my yummy in the bummy tummy.&#x201d; At Zafoona&#x2019;s nod she speared a large sliver.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; squawked Noor in mock anger. &#x201c;Leave some for us.&#x201d; She poked Mariam in her ticklish spot, under the ribs, and got a loud giggle.<br><br>&#x201c;I only took a tiny, tiny piece!&#x201d; squealed Mariam, and wiggled out of the way.<br><br>&#x201c;Girls, behave yourselves,&#x201d; said Zafoona, casting them a weary disapproving glance.<br><br>While Mariam spread cheese on the bread, her expression turned serious. She glanced at Noor with pursed lips. &#x201c;Hey, Noor,&#x201d; she said in a loud whisper.<br><br>&#x201c;What, Ms. Yummy in the Bummy Tummy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need your help with something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will you teach me how to sew Gulmina a new dress?&#x201d; Next to Mariam&#x2019;s plate sat a Barbie that was the envy of all her friends. She&#x2019;d inherited Gulmina from Noor when her older sister had outgrown it. And now, even though the doll&#x2019;s features had faded and she was missing her left hand, Gulmina accompanied Mariam everywhere.<br><br>Noor took a piece of cheese and looked at her younger sister with a raised eyebrow.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, please, pretty please?&#x201d; begged Mariam. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do your chores this whole week&#x2014;peel the potatoes and turnips, take out the garbage, and iron the clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know ... ,&#x201d; began Noor. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not even allowed to use the iron&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; cried Mariam. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want.&#x201d; She put on her sad puppy-dog face and flashed two dimples at her older sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, all right.&#x201d; Noor sighed. &#x201c;I guess there&#x2019;s nothing better to do than design a new wardrobe for Gulmina the Glamorous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said Mariam eagerly. She chattered on about what colors to use, mostly lavender and pink, while braiding Gulmina&#x2019;s patchy honey-colored hair.<br><br>Fadi tuned out his sisters&#x2019; phenomenally boring conversation, added a chunk of crumbly brown sugar to his watered-down hot milk, and stirred. He watched fat snowflakes swirl through the crisp air and land in the backyard. He shut his left eye and pretended to look through the viewfinder of his father&#x2019;s old camera, which Habib had given to Fadi for his eleventh birthday, a few months before. He squinted, framing the old plum tree against the cloudless blue sky. He wished the weather were better. Maybe he could have convinced his father to take him to the quiet back hills of the city to take pictures. But, no. It was too cold&#x2014;and too risky&#x2014;to be caught with a camera. His eye fluttered open as his father cleared his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I have something I need to tell you,&#x201d; said Habib.<br><br>Fadi glanced away from the accumulating snow with a frown. His father didn&#x2019;t sound like himself.<br><br>&#x201c;The situation has become too dangerous for us here,&#x201d; said Habib. There were deep circles under his eyes, as if he hadn&#x2019;t slept for many nights.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Situation.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s an understatement,</i> thought Fadi as he resumed stirring his milk. Over the past year things had gotten more and more frightening. Even going out for bread could get you in all sorts of trouble.<br><br>&#x201c;And so it&#x2019;s set. We are leaving,&#x201d; announced Habib, looking around the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving?&#x201d; Fadi mumbled, blinking slowly, like a confused owl.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Noor, as her fork dropped with a loud clang.<br><br>Zafoona sat calmly. It was as if she had been expecting the news.<br><br>&#x201c;Father, what do you mean we&#x2019;re leaving?&#x201d; asked Noor.<br><br>Even Mariam, who&#x2019;d been busy scraping out the last of the honey from a metal tin, paused to stare at her father. &#x201c;<i>Why</i> are we leaving?&#x201d; she asked, her brows knitted in confusion.<br><br>&#x201c;Your mother needs better medical care,&#x201d; said Habib.<br><br>Fadi glanced at his mother&#x2019;s pale face. She sat shivering, cold despite wearing two sweaters, one of Habib&#x2019;s old coats, and a shawl. She&#x2019;d caught a cold at the beginning of winter and it had gotten worse. The few doctors left in Kabul didn&#x2019;t have the right equipment to diagnose what was ailing her or the right medication to make her better. She&#x2019;d taken a turn for the worse the week before when they&#x2019;d buried her mother, Fadi&#x2019;s grandmother, in the cold, hard ground next to her husband.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because of <i>them</i>, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Mariam, her eyes wise beyond her six years.<br><br>They all knew who she meant&#x2014;<i>them</i>, the Taliban.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, <i>jaan</i>.&#x201d; Habib sighed, reaching across the table to ruffle Mariam&#x2019;s fine reddish brown hair. &#x201c;The Taliban have made it very difficult for us here.&#x201d;<br><br>Zafoona cradled her steaming cup in her hands. &#x201c;It had to come to this,&#x201d; she murmured, muffling a cough.<br><br>&#x201c;You were right, Zafoona <i>jaan</i>,&#x201d; Habib said with a deep sigh. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t have come back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You only had the best intentions for the country ... for the people,&#x201d; said Zafoona. She patted her husband&#x2019;s hand. Her face was laced with sadness and a trace of pity.<br><br>Mariam frowned, looking from one parent to the other. &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;We shouldn&#x2019;t have come back&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mariam <i>jaan</i>,&#x201d; said Zafoona, giving her youngest daughter a resigned look. &#x201c;Remember I told you we used to live in America?&#x201d;<br><br>Mariam nodded. &#x201c;Father went to university there to get his P ... PH ... PH something.&#x201d;<br><br>Noor wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;PhD, silly. Doctorate of Philosophy in Agriculture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, PhD,&#x201d; said Mariam, grimacing at Noor&#x2019;s know-it-all-ness.<br><br>&#x201c;You were born in America, in Wisconsin,&#x201d; added Noor.<br><br>&#x201c;But why did we come back to Afghanistan, then?&#x201d; asked Mariam, her sticky fingers drumming against the table, the honey tin forgotten.<br><br>&#x201c;Father and Mother wanted to help the people in Afghanistan,&#x201d; said Fadi, trying to shut her up. He wanted to know more about how they were going to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;And you did help them? Right?&#x201d; prodded Mariam. Zafoona&#x2019;s lips tightened at her impertinence, but she stayed silent.<br><br>Fadi rolled his eyes. Mariam somehow managed to get away with everything.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, <i>jaan</i>,&#x201d; explained Habib, as if trying to remember it all himself. &#x201c;When we returned to Afghanistan, the Taliban asked me to help get rid of the country&#x2019;s vast poppy fields that were used to make drugs.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi had heard this all before, how Afghanistan had become the world&#x2019;s largest producer of opium and how the heroin derived from the poppies was ruining the country.<br><br>Mariam nodded uncomfortably. She had seen the thin, ragged drug addicts huddled on street corners, begging for scraps.<br><br>&#x201c;Slowly I convinced the farmers to destroy their poppy plants and start growing food for the hungry people,&#x201d; said Habib.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father worked very hard,&#x201d; interrupted Zafoona, &#x201c;but things didn&#x2019;t work out as we&#x2019;d hoped.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi looked at his father&#x2019;s defeated expression with growing apprehension. His father had always been optimistic, even during the most difficult times.<br><br>&#x201c;But if the Taliban did such a good thing, why are they bad now?&#x201d; asked Mariam.<br><br>&#x201c;Mariam,&#x201d; said Zafoona, her tone full of warning.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Habib, holding up a weary hand. He turned to Mariam, his expression solemn. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s human nature, Mariam <i>jaan</i>. Whenever someone is handed lots of power, they have a tendency to abuse it. The Taliban was a group of young religious students. When they first came to power, they brought peace and order to the country. But with time their strict interpretation of Islam began suppressing the people they&#x2019;d helped free.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why they made you grow a beard,&#x201d; Mariam said, and smiled, reaching out to stroke her father&#x2019;s face.<br><br>Habib laughed. &#x201c;Yes, they did, didn&#x2019;t they? But what they don&#x2019;t see is that you cannot force someone to be religious. It must come from their heart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair,&#x201d; burst out Noor. &#x201c;The Taliban is oppressing everyone, with a version of Islam that they&#x2019;ve cooked up. They&#x2019;ve banned everything! Music, movies, books, photography, and kite flying. Show me where it says that in the <i>Qur&#x2019;an</i>. Show me!&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi knew that wasn&#x2019;t the main reason she was upset. Although many women in Afghanistan traditionally chose to wear the burka, a head-to-toe covering&#x2014;including his grandmother and his aunts&#x2014;the Taliban now made it mandatory. Women were compelled to cover up when they ventured outside. Worst of all, they&#x2019;d closed down the girls&#x2019; schools, saying the schools would reopen when stability and safety had been restored to the country.<br><br>Zafoona murmured, &#x201c;Oppression is the worst thing in Allah&#x2019;s eyes. He forbade it not only for himself but also for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; said Habib, &#x201c;but unfortunately, the world is full of oppression&#x2014;oppression of men against men, group against group, and nation against nation.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi sighed. Life in Afghanistan had become more and more dangerous for their family, especially since the Taliban&#x2019;s most recent visit to their house.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d; grumbled Noor, interrupting Fadi&#x2019;s thoughts. She tapped her foot and pulled back her burka, revealing flashing brown eyes under arched eyebrows.<br><br>&#x201c;They should be here any minute,&#x201d; Habib said in a soothing voice.<br><br>Fadi pulled Mariam under the tattered awning as she tried to inch toward a skinny dog nosing through a pile of garbage. She hadn&#x2019;t spoken a word during the white-knuckled six-hour ride from their home in the capital city of Kabul. Now she clutched Gulmina at her side and looked up at Fadi, a frown marring her usually cheerful round face.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be great, you&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s lots of chocolate where we&#x2019;re going. And Barbies,&#x201d; he added with a grin.<br><br>She nodded, fingering the bright pink burka that enveloped Gulmina. Noor had sewn it for her just the week before, during a fit of boredom.

Months of meticulous planning and secret training hung in the balance during three minutes of mayhem as the officers boldly stormed the huge double fences at Oflag Prison. Employing wooden ladders and bridges previously disguised as bookshelves, the highly coordinated effort succeeded and set 36 men free into the German countryside. Later known as the 'Warburg Wire Job', fellow prisoner and fighter ace Douglas Bader once described the attempt as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'.</p><p>The first author to tackle this remarkable story in detail, historian Mark Felton brilliantly evokes the suspense of the escape and the adventures of those escapees who managed to elude the Germans, as well as the courage of the civilians who risked their lives to help them in enemy territory. Fantastically intimate and told with a novelist's eye for drama and detail, this rip-roaring adventure is all the more thrilling because it really happened.</p></p><p>MARK FELTON has written over a dozen books on prisoners of war, Japanese war crimes and Nazi war criminals, and writes regularly for magazines such as <i>Military History Monthly</i> and <i>World War II</i> including <i>China Station: The British Military in the Middle Kingdom, 1839-1997</i>.

Constructed as a series of interrelated portraits that combine the personal and the political, the book includes philosophers, historians, journalists, and activists such as Hannah Arendt, Arthur Koestler, I. F. Stone, and Noam Chomsky. In their engagement with Zionism, these influential thinkers also wrestled with the twentieth century&#x2019;s most crucial political dilemmas: socialism, nationalism, democracy, colonialism, terrorism, and anti-Semitism. In other words, in probing Zionism, they confronted the very nature of modernity and the often catastrophic histories of our time. By examining these leftist intellectuals, Linfield also seeks to understand how the contemporary Left has become focused on anti-Zionism and how Israel itself has moved rightward.</p><p>Cultural critic Susie Linfield investigates how eight prominent midcentury public intellectuals struggled with the philosophy of Zionism, and then with Israel and its conflicts with the Arab world.

The book's epigraph and title are from "The Letter Writer," a story by the Yiddish writer and Nobel Laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer: "In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka." The first part of the book (Chapter 1-2) describes the emergence of human beings as the master species and their domination over the rest of the inhabitants of the earth. The second part (Chapters 3-5) examines the industrialization of slaughter (of both animals and humans) that took place in modern times. The last part of the book (Chapters 6-8) profiles Jewish and German animal advocates on both sides of the Holocaust, including Isaac Bashevis Singer himself.</p> <p>The Foreword is by Lucy Rosen Kaplan, former attorney for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and daughter of Holocaust survivors. Her foreword, the Preface and Afterword, excerpts from the book, chapter synopses, and an international list of supporters can be found on the book's website at: www.powerfulbook.com </p></p><p>I'm dedicating the book to the great Yiddish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-91), the first major writer to focus on the "Nazi" way we treat animals. The first two parts of the book (Chapters 1-5) put the issue in historical perspective, while the last part (Chapters 6-8) profiles Jews and Germans whose animal advocacy has been, at least to some extent, shaped by the Holocaust. <p>The conviction of Albert Camus that "it is a writer's responsibility to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves" helped me persevere through the writing of this book. When it looked as if I might never find a publisher brave enough to publish it (some said the book was "too strong"), I took comfort from Franz Kafka's view: "I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn't shake us awake like a blow to the skull, why bother reading it in the first place? So it can make us happy? Good God, we'd be just as happy if we had no books at all....A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us." </p><p>If the issue of the exploitation and slaughter of animals moves to center stage in the twenty-first century the way the issue of human slavery did in America in the nineteenth century--and I think it will--my hope is that this book will be in the thick of the debate. --from Preface</p>ETERNAL TREBLINKA Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust Charles Patterson <p>The title of the book is from "The Letter Writer," a short story by the Yiddish writer and Nobel Laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-91), to whom the book is dedicated: "In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka." </p><p>The book examines the origins of human supremacy, describes the emergence of industrialized slaughter of both animals and people in modern times, and concludes with profiles of Jewish and German animal advocates on both sides of the Holocaust, including Isaac Bashevis Singer himself. </p><p>"In Eternal Treblinka we are presented for the first time with extensive evidence of the profoundly troubling connections between animal exploitation in the United States and Hitler's Final Solution."--from the Foreword by Lucy Rosen Kaplan, Esq. </p><p>"Charles Patterson's book will go a long way towards righting the terrible wrongs that human beings, throughout history, have perpetrated on non-human animals.

The narrative of a boy who lived through Auschwitz and Buchenwald provides a short and terrible indictment of modern humanity.</p><p>In Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel's memoir <i>Night</i>, a scholarly, pious teenager is wracked with guilt at having survived the horror of the Holocaust and the genocidal campaign that consumed his family. His memories of the nightmare world of the death camps present him with an intolerable question: how can the God he once so fervently believed in have allowed these monstrous events to occur? There are no easy answers in this harrowing book, which probes life's essential riddles with the lucid anguish only great literature achieves. It marks the crucial first step in Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died.Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944 to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. <i>Night</i> is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. This new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects important details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel's testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must never be allowed to happen again.

It has been stated that Albert Pike&#39;s &#34;Magnum Opus Morals and Dogma&#34; no longer has any relevance to Scottish Rite Masons. For many, it has become an esoteric antediluvian composition, a momentous work deemed too difficult for the average person to comprehend or to glean information from. Albert Pike composed his esoteric information so as not to reveal any Masonic secrets, understanding that non-Mason and Mason alike would be exploring the degrees contained within. Could he have concealed information within his writings, as did many of the great artists and thinkers of the past? For the first time, Professor Len Seymour provides an interpretation of the enigmatic drawing of an Egyptian Stele found in Pike&#39;s book, &#34;Morals and Dogma,&#34; the timeless and hidden symbolism of which has remained a mystery until now.</p><p></p><h2>Their Morals and Ours</h2><p>Participating in the revolutionary workers movement &#34;with open eyes and an intense will--only this can give the highest moral satisfaction to a thinking being,&#34; Trotsky writes.

For more than six decades, the opposed and overlapping missions of the FBI and CIA -- and the rival personalities of cops and spies -- have caused fistfights and turf tangles, breakdowns and cover-ups, public scandals and tragic deaths. <br> A grand panorama of dramatic episodes, peopled by picaresque secret agents from Ian Fleming to Oliver North, <i>Wedge</i> is both a journey and a warning. From Pearl Harbor, McCarthyism, and the plots to kill Castro through the JFK assassination, Watergate, and Iran Contra down to the Aldrich Ames affair, Robert Hanssen's treachery, and the hunt for Al Qaeda -- <i>Wedge</i> shows the price America has paid for its failure to resolve the conflict between law enforcement and intelligence. <br> Gripping and authoritative -- and updated with an important new epilogue, carrying the action through to September 11, 2001 -- <i>Wedge</i> is the only book about the schism that has informed nearly every major blunder in American espionage.</p><p>Mark Riebling is a pathbreaking writer on secret intellingence. &nbsp;An architect of post 9/11 "intelligence-driven policing," he implemented a Presidential Finding to make New York City the first city-state since the Rennassiance to build its own spy service. &nbsp;Currently he is Fellow in 20th-Century History at Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and lecturer in Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Georgetown University.

A native of Pasadena, California, he was educated at Dartmouth, Berkeley, and Columbia."A brilliant book. Outstanding research and superlative presentation of the dramatis personae. An anecdotal and extremely well written account -- as informative as any treatise and as entertaining as the best espionage novels." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br>"If the book's thesis -- that the FBI-CIA rivalry had "damaged the national security and, to that extent, imperiled the Republic" -- was provocative at the time, it seems prescient now, with missed communications between the two agencies looming as the principal cause of intelligence failures related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks." - Vernon Loeb, <i>Washington Post</i><br>"Riebling's analysis has now become conventional wisdom, accepted on all sides. Such, indeed, is the reasoning behind virtually all of the proposals now under consideration by no fewer than seven assorted congressional committees, internal evaluators, and blue-ribbon panels charged with remedying the intelligence situation." -- Andrew C. McCarthy, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"A lively and engaging narrative of interagency bungling, infighting, malfeasance and nonfeasance, providing fresh and well-rounded portraits of well-known (and ought-to-be-well-known) agents -- drawing on scores of original and rewarding interviews." -- Richard Gid Powers, front page, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br>"Wedge compellingly re-creates the life-or-death atmosphere of the half-century of American confrontation with the Soviet Union. Mr. Riebling succeeds brilliantly as well in persuading the reader that the FBI-CIA conflict was a more important piece of the cold war mosaic than heretofore noted by historians." -- Michael R. Beschloss, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"The fact that Riebling has taken great pains to avoid using anonymous sources is just one of a number of reasons why serious students of this nation's haywire-rigged counterintelligence effort should read Wedge. The cumulative effect of his tales is staggering." --John Fialka, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"Well researched, wittily written, full of good judgments.

Reprint.</p><p>David Weber is a science fiction phenomenon. His popular Honor Harrington space-opera adventures are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers and can&#39;t come out fast enough for his devoted readers. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina.Fans of space opera who have been eagerly awaiting this sequel to Weber and White's In Death Ground (1997) won't be disappointed, to put it mildly. Humanity and its various allies find themselves under attack by an enemy with whom no communication, let alone coexistence, is possible, since their foes lack individual sentience and are driven by a Darwinian imperative to regard all other life forms as food sources. Countered against this nightmare are an assortment of diverse species, some unknown to one another, who share the ability to make moral choices, "including the ultimate choice of sacrificing that very individual consciousness in the name of what all of us recognize, in one form or another, for what it is: honor." This capacity is stretched when it is discovered that, in this war, genocide is a tactical weapon. The authors have created a fictional reality with all of the verisimilitude of a technothriller, but this doesn't credit them enough, since unlike, say, Tom Clancy, they have had to create their own weapons, tactics and even societies. Characterizations are strong and vivid, particularly the Human and Orion command team that spearheads the fight and a fighter pilot who's haunted by the ghosts of her dead. Ultimately, Weber and White have written an exposition, in the form of a novel, of Heinlein's axiom that "ethics are a survival mechanism," leaving the reader both exhilarated and enriched.

Folks across America had little trouble equating the insidious wildcat Simple J. Malarkey with the ascendant anti-Communist senator, Joseph McCarthy. The subject was sensitive enough that by the following year a Providence, Rhode Island newspaper threatened to drop the strip if Malarkey's face were to appear in it again. Kelly's response? He had Malarkey appear again but put a bag over the character's head for his next appearance. Ergo, his face did not appear. (Typical of Kelly's layers of verbal wit, the character Malarkey was hiding from was a Rhode Island Red hen, referencing both the source of his need to conceal Malarkey and the underlying political controversy.) The entirety of these sequences can be found in this book. But the Malarkey storyline is only a tiny portion of those rich, eventful two years, which include such classic sequences as con-man Seminole Sam's attempts to corner the market on water (which Porkypine's Uncle Baldwin tries to one-up by cornering the market on dirt); a return engagement of Pup Dog and Houndog's blank-eyed Little Orphan Annie parody Li'l Arf and Nonny; Churchy La Femme going in drag to deliver a love poem he wrote, Cyrano style, on Deacon Mush-rat's behalf to Sis Boombah (the aforementioned hen); P.T. Bridgeport's return to the swamp in search of new talent; and of course two rousing choruses of Deck Us All With Boston Charlie. In addition to presenting all of 1953 and 1954's daily strips complete and in order for the first time anywhere (many of them once again scanned from original syndicate proofs, for their crispest and most detailed appearance ever), Pogo Volume 3: Evidence to the Contrary also contains all 104 Sunday strips from these two years, presented in lush full color for the first time since their original appearance in Sunday sections 60 years ago plus the usual in-depth Swamp Talk historical annotations by R.C. Harvey, spectacular samples of Kelly's work scanned from original art, and a whole lot more! <br></p><p>Walt Kelly is the creator of the legendary Pogo comic strip. He was born in 1913 and passed away in 1973.&#x201c;...<em>Evidence To The Contrary</em> gives us Kelly at his most self-assured, an artist whose facility with both caricature and dialect convinces us that an alligator named Albert really does enjoy nothing more than a good cigar; that an owl named Howland wears a gravity-defying wizard&#x2019;s cap; and that the guilelessness of a likable possum named Pogo can be a surprisingly effective weapon against the fulminations of mere politicians.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ben Marks, <em>Boing Boing</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Pogo</em> is] so dense with things to look at, enjoy and understand &#x2015; clever dialogue, jokes, satire, physical humor, amazing cartooning, lush inking, incredible lettering and more... It&#x2019;s all so perfectly done, seemingly effortless and simple, but actually the product of a rare talent. ...I can&#x2019;t recommend [this series] highly enough.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Todd Klein, <em>(Eisner Award-winning letterer and designer)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...Kelly continues to be in top form in both storytelling and illustration, that same quality Fantagraphics upholds and highlights over 60 years later. Half in black and white, half in wonderful Sunday Funnies colors, the third volume continues to make Kelly&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Pogo</em>&nbsp;a favorite of every generation of readers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cameron Hatheway, <em>Bleeding Cool</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Pogo is so richly developed in atmosphere, language and funny, funny animals that no matter how old you are, within in two panels you fall right into the world of Okefenokee Swamp. ...The art looks as if it came from the greatest of children&#x2019;s literature. The words ring with the wit of Jonathan Swift while at the same they sing with the musicality of Irish poetry. ... Stories flow across days and weeks as if they were written by Scheherazade, Aesop, and H. L. Mencken at a laugh-filled lunch hosted by Meet the Press. ... This volume is a true work of love and is perfect for all ages.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Squirek, <em>New York Journal of Books</em></strong></p><h2>Mysteries of Small Houses: Poems (Penguin Poets)</h2><p>Alice Notley vividly reconstructs the mysteries, longings, and emotions of her past in this brilliant new collection of poems that charts her growth from young girl to young woman to accomplished artist. In this volume, memories of her childhood in the California desert spring to life through evocative renderings of the American landscape, circa 1950. Likewise, her coming of age as a poet in the turbulent sixties is evoked through the era's angry, creative energy. As she looks backward with the perspective that time and age allows, Notley ably captures the immediacy of youth's passion while offering her own dry-eyed interpretations of the events of a life lived close to the bone. Like the colorful collages she assembles from paper and other found materials, Notley erects structures of image and feeling to house the memories that swirl around her in the present.In their feverish, intelligent renderings of moments both precise and ephemeral, Notley's poems manage to mirror and transcend the times they evoke. Her profound tributes to the stages of her life and to the identities she has assumed&#x2014;child, youth, lover, poet, wife, mother, friend, and widow�are remarkable for their insight and wisdom, and for the courage of their unblinking gaze.</p><p><b>Alice Notley</b> is a poet whose twenty previous titles include <b>The Descent of Alette, Beginning with a Stain, Homer's Art</b>, and <b>Selected Poems</b>.

Looking dizzily down. I suck in a breath of icy air.<br> <br>Above me are stars. Below me, the bronze statue of Colonel Wallingford makes me realize I&#x2019;m seeing the quad from the peak of Smythe Hall, my dorm.<br> <br>I have no memory of climbing the stairs up to the roof. I don&#x2019;t even know <i>how</i> to get where I am, which is a problem since I&#x2019;m going to have to get down, ideally in a way that doesn&#x2019;t involve dying.<br> <br>Teetering, I will myself to be as still as possible. Not to inhale too sharply. To grip the slate with my toes.<br> <br>The night is quiet, the kind of hushed middle-of-the-night quiet that makes every shuffle or nervous panting breath echo. When the black outlines of trees overhead rustle, I jerk in surprise. My foot slides on something slick. Moss.<br> <br>I try to steady myself, but my legs go out from under me.<br> <br>I scrabble for something to hold on to as my bare chest slams down on the slate. My palm comes down hard on a sharp bit of copper flashing, but I hardly feel the pain. Kicking out, my foot finds a snow guard, and I press my toes against it, steadying myself. I laugh with relief, even though I am shaking so badly that climbing is out of the question.<br> <br>Cold makes my fingers numb. The adrenaline rush makes my brain sing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Help,&#x201d; I say softly, and feel crazy nervous laughter bubble up my throat. I bite the inside of my cheek to tamp it down.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t ask for help. I can&#x2019;t call anyone. If I do, then my carefully maintained pretense that I&#x2019;m just a regular guy is going to fade forever. Sleepwalking is kid&#x2019;s stuff, weird and embarrassing.<br> <br>Looking across the roof in the dim light, I try to make out the pattern of snow guards, tiny triangular pieces of clear plastic that keep ice from falling in a sheet, tiny triangular pieces that were never meant to hold my weight. If I can get closer to a window, maybe I can climb down.<br> <br>I edge my foot out, shifting as slowly as I can and worming toward the nearest snow guard. My stomach scrapes against the slate, some of the tiles chipped and uneven beneath me. I step onto the first guard, then down to another and across to one at the edge of the roof. There, panting, with the windows too far beneath me and with nowhere left to go, I decide I am not willing to die from embarrassment.<br> <br>I suck in three deep breaths of cold air and yell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey! Hey! Help!&#x201d; The night absorbs my voice. I hear the distant swell of engines along the highway, but nothing from the windows below me.<br> <br>&#x201c;HEY!&#x201d; I scream it this time, guttural, as loudly as I can, loud enough that the words scrape my throat raw. <i>&#x201c;Help!&#x201d;</i><br> <br>A light flickers on in one of the rooms and I see the press of palms against a glass pane. A moment later the window slides open. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; someone calls sleepily from below. For a moment her voice reminds me of another girl. A dead girl.<br> <br>I hang my head off the side and try to give my most chagrined smile. Like she shouldn&#x2019;t freak out. &#x201c;Up here,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;On the roof.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; Justine Moore gasps.<br> <br>Willow Davis comes to the window. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting the hall master.&#x201d;<br> <br>I press my cheek against the cold tile and try to convince myself that everything&#x2019;s okay, that it&#x2019;s not a curse, that if I just hang on a little longer, things are going to be fine.<br> <br>A crowd gathers below me, spilling out of the dorms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jump,&#x201d; some jerk shouts. &#x201c;Do it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Sharpe?&#x201d; Dean Wharton calls. &#x201c;Come down from there at once, Mr. Sharpe!&#x201d; His silver hair sticks up like he&#x2019;s been electrocuted, and his robe is inside out and badly tied. The whole school can see his tighty-whities.<br> <br>I realize abruptly that I&#x2019;m wearing only boxers. If he looks ridiculous, I look worse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cassel!&#x201d; Ms. Noyes yells. &#x201c;Cassel, don&#x2019;t jump! I know things have been hard . . .&#x201d; She stops there, like she isn&#x2019;t quite sure what to say next. She&#x2019;s probably trying to remember what&#x2019;s so hard. I have good grades. Play well with others.<br> <br>I look down again. Camera phones flash. Freshmen hang out of windows next door in Strong House, and juniors and seniors stand around on the grass in their pajamas and nightgowns, even though teachers are desperately trying to herd them back inside.<br> <br>I give my best grin. &#x201c;Cheese,&#x201d; I say softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get down, Mr. Sharpe,&#x201d; yells Dean Wharton. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m warning you!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay, Ms. Noyes,&#x201d; I call. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how I got up here. I think I was sleepwalking.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d dreamed of a white cat. It leaned over me, inhaling sharply, as if it was going to suck the breath from my lungs, but then it bit out my tongue instead. There was no pain, only a sense of overwhelming, suffocating panic. In the dream my tongue was a wriggling red thing, mouse-size and wet, that the cat carried in her mouth. I wanted it back. I sprang up out of the bed and grabbed for her, but she was too lean and too quick. I chased her. The next thing I knew, I was teetering on a slate roof.<br> <br>A siren wails in the distance, drawing closer. My cheeks hurt from smiling.<br> <br>Eventually a fireman climbs a ladder to get me down. They put a blanket around me, but by then my teeth are chattering so hard that I can&#x2019;t answer any of their questions. It&#x2019;s like the cat bit out my tongue after all.<br> <br>The last time I was in the headmistress&#x2019;s office, my grandfather was there with me to enroll me at the school. I remember watching him empty a crystal dish of peppermints into the pocket of his coat while Dean Wharton talked about what a fine young man I would be turned into. The crystal dish went into the opposite pocket.<br> <br>Wrapped in a blanket, I sit in the same green leather chair and pick at the gauze covering my palm. A fine young man indeed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sleepwalking?&#x201d; Dean Wharton says. He&#x2019;s dressed in a brown tweed suit, but his hair is still wild. He stands near a shelf of outdated encyclopedias and strokes a gloved finger over their crumbling leather spines.<br> <br>I notice there&#x2019;s a new cheap glass dish of mints on the desk. My head is pounding. I wish the mints were aspirin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I used to sleepwalk,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t done it in a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>Somnambulism isn&#x2019;t all that uncommon in kids, boys especially. I looked it up online after waking in the driveway when I was thirteen, my lips blue with cold, unable to shake the eerie feeling that I&#x2019;d just returned from somewhere I couldn&#x2019;t quite recall.<br> <br>Outside the leaded glass windows the rising sun limns the trees with gold. The headmistress, Ms. Northcutt, looks puffy and red-eyed. She&#x2019;s drinking coffee out of a mug with the Wallingford logo on it and gripping it so tightly the leather of her gloves over her knuckles is pulled taut.<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard you&#x2019;ve been having some problems with your girlfriend,&#x201d; Headmistress Northcutt says.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; Audrey broke up with me after the winter holiday, exhausted by my moodiness. It&#x2019;s impossible to have problems with a girlfriend who&#x2019;s no longer mine.<br> <br>The headmistress clears her throat. &#x201c;Some students think you are running a betting pool. Are you in some kind of trouble? Owe someone money?&#x201d;<br> <br>I look down and try not to smile at the mention of my tiny criminal empire. It&#x2019;s just a little forgery and some bookmaking. I&#x2019;m not running a single con; I haven&#x2019;t even taken up my brother Philip&#x2019;s suggestion that we could be the school&#x2019;s main supplier for underage booze. I&#x2019;m pretty sure the headmistress doesn&#x2019;t care about betting, but I&#x2019;m glad she doesn&#x2019;t know that the most popular odds are on which teachers are hooking up. Northcutt and Wharton are a long shot, but that doesn&#x2019;t stop people laying cash on them. I shake my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you experienced mood swings lately?&#x201d; Dean Wharton asks.<br> <br><i>&#x201c;No,&#x201d;</i> I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about changes in appetite or sleep patterns?&#x201d; He sounds like he&#x2019;s reciting the words from a book.<br> <br>&#x201c;The problem is my sleep patterns,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; asks Headmistress Northcutt, suddenly intent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing! Just that I was <i>sleepwalking</i>, not trying to kill myself. And if I wanted to kill myself, I wouldn&#x2019;t throw myself off a roof. And if I <i>was</i> going to throw myself off a roof, I would put on some pants before I did it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The headmistress takes a sip from her cup. She&#x2019;s relaxed her grip. &#x201c;Our lawyer advised me that until a doctor can assure us that nothing like this will happen again, we can&#x2019;t allow you to stay in the dorms. You&#x2019;re too much of an insurance liability.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought that people would give me a lot of crap, but I never thought there would be any real consequences. I thought I was going to get a scolding. Maybe even a couple of demerits. I&#x2019;m too stunned to say anything for a long moment. &#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t do anything wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>Which is stupid, of course. Things don&#x2019;t happen to people because they deserve them. Besides, I&#x2019;ve done plenty wrong.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your brother Philip is coming to pick you up,&#x201d; Dean Wharton says. He and the headmistress exchange looks, and Wharton&#x2019;s hand goes unconsciously to his neck, where I see the colored cord and the outline of the amulet under his white shirt.<br> <br>I get it. They&#x2019;re wondering if I&#x2019;ve been worked. Cursed. It&#x2019;s not that big a secret that my grandfather was a death worker for the Zacharov family. He&#x2019;s got the blackened stubs where his fingers used to be to prove it. And if they read the paper, they know about my mother. It&#x2019;s not a big leap for Wharton and Northcutt to blame any and all strangeness concerning me on curse work.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t kick me out for sleepwalking,&#x201d; I say, getting to my feet. &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be legal. Some kind of discrimination against&#x2014;&#x201d; I stop speaking as cold dread settles in my stomach, because for a moment I wonder if I could have been cursed. I try to think back to whether someone brushed me with a hand, but I can&#x2019;t recall anyone touching me who wasn&#x2019;t clearly gloved.<br> <br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t come to any determination about your future here at Wallingford yet.&#x201d; The headmistress leafs through some of the papers on her desk. The dean pours himself a coffee.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can still be a day student.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t want to sleep in an empty house or crash with either of my brothers, but I will. I&#x2019;ll do whatever lets me keep my life the way it is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go to your dorm and pack some things. Consider yourself on medical leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just until I get a doctor&#x2019;s note,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>Neither of them replies, and after a few moments of standing awkwardly, I head for the door.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t be too sympathetic. Here&#x2019;s the essential truth about me: I killed a girl when I was fourteen. Her name was Lila, she was my best friend, and I loved her. I killed her anyway. There&#x2019;s a lot of the murder that seems like a blur, but my brothers found me standing over her body with blood on my hands and a weird smile tugging at my mouth. What I remember most is the feeling I had looking down at Lila&#x2014;the giddy glee of having gotten away with something.<br> <br>No one knows I&#x2019;m a murderer except my family. And me, of course.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t want to be that person, so I spend most of my time at school faking and lying. It takes a lot of effort to pretend you&#x2019;re something you&#x2019;re not. I don&#x2019;t think about what music I like; I think about what music I should like. When I had a girlfriend, I tried to convince her I was the guy she wanted me to be. When I&#x2019;m in a crowd, I hang back until I can figure out how to make them laugh. Luckily, if there&#x2019;s one thing I&#x2019;m good at, it&#x2019;s faking and lying.<br> <br>I told you I&#x2019;d done plenty wrong.<br> <br>I pad, still barefoot, still wrapped in the scratchy fireman&#x2019;s blanket, across the sunlit quad and up to my dorm room. Sam Yu, my roommate, is looping a skinny tie around the collar of a wrinkled dress shirt when I walk through the door. He looks up, startled.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I say wearily. &#x201c;In case you were going to ask.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam&#x2019;s a horror film enthusiast and hard-core science geek who has covered our dorm room with bug-eyed alien masks and gore-spattered posters. His parents want him to go to MIT and from there to some profitable pharmaceuticals gig. He wants to do special effects for movies. Despite the facts that he&#x2019;s built like a bear and is obsessed with fake blood, he has so far failed to stand up to them to the degree that they don&#x2019;t even know there&#x2019;s a disagreement. I like to think we&#x2019;re sort of friends.<br> <br>We don&#x2019;t hang out with many of the same people, which makes being sort of friends easier.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t doing . . . whatever you think I was doing,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to die or anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam smiles and pulls on his Wallingford gloves. &#x201c;I was just going to say that it&#x2019;s a good thing you don&#x2019;t sleep commando.&#x201d;<br> <br>I snort and drop onto my cot. The frame squeaks in protest. On the pillow next to my head rests a new envelope, marked with a code telling me a freshman wants to put fifty dollars on Victoria Quaroni to win the talent show. The odds are astronomical, but the money reminds me that someone&#x2019;s going to have to keep the books and pay out while I&#x2019;m away.<br> <br>Sam kicks the base of the footboard lightly. &#x201c;You sure you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod. I know I should tell him that I&#x2019;m going home, that he&#x2019;s about to become one of those lucky guys with a single, but I don&#x2019;t want to disturb my own fragile sense of normalcy. &#x201c;Just tired.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam picks up his backpack. &#x201c;See you in class, crazy-man.&#x201d;<br> <br>I raise my bandaged hand in farewell, then stop myself. &#x201c;Hey, wait a sec.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hand on the doorknob, he turns.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just thinking . . . if I&#x2019;m gone. Do you think you could let people keep dropping off the money here?&#x201d; It bothers me to ask, simultaneously putting me in his debt and making the whole kicked-out thing real, but I&#x2019;m not ready to give up the one thing I&#x2019;ve got going for me at Wallingford.<br> <br>He hesitates.<br> <br>&#x201c;Forget it,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Pretend I never&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He interrupts me. &#x201c;Do I get a percentage?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-five,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Twenty-five percent. But you&#x2019;re going to have to do more than just collect the money for that.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods slowly. &#x201c;Yeah, okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grin. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the most trustworthy guy I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Flattery will get you everywhere,&#x201d; Sam says. &#x201c;Except, apparently, off a roof.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; I say with a groan. I push myself off the bed and take a clean pair of itchy black uniform pants out of the dresser.<br> <br>&#x201c;So why would you be <i>gone</i>? They&#x2019;re not kicking you out, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pulling on the pants, I turn my face away, but I can&#x2019;t keep the unease out of my voice. &#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t know. Let me set you up.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods. &#x201c;Okay. What do I do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you my notebook on point spreads, tallies, everything, and you just fill in whatever bets you get.&#x201d; I stand, pulling my desk chair over to the closet and hopping up on the seat. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; My fingers close on the notebook I taped above the door. I rip it down. Another one from sophomore year is still up there, from when business got big enough I could no longer rely on my pretty-good-but-not-photographic memory.<br> <br>Sam half-smiles. I can tell he&#x2019;s amazed that he never noticed my hiding spot. &#x201c;I think I can manage that.&#x201d;<br> <br>The pages he&#x2019;s flipping through are records of all the bets made since the beginning of our junior year at Wallingford, and the odds on each.

Camped out in the splendid palaces of the former regime, the city&#x2019;s new masters seek to cement their control, even as the counterrevolutionary White Army regroups. <i>Conquered City</i>, Victor Serge&#x2019;s most unrelenting narrative, is structured like a detective story, one in which the new political regime tracks down and eliminates its enemies&#x2014;the spies, speculators, and&nbsp;traitors hidden among the mass of common people.&nbsp;<br><br> <i>Conquered City</i> is about terror: the Red Terror and the White Terror. But mainly about the Red, the Communists who have dared to pick up the weapons of power&#x2014;police, guns, jails, spies, treachery&#x2014;in the doomed gamble that by wielding them righteously, they can put an end to the need for terror, perhaps forever. Conquered City is their tragedy and testament.</p><p>Victor Serge (1890&#x2013;1947) was born Victor Lvovich Kibalchich to Russian anti-czarist exiles, impoverished intellectuals living &#x201c;by chance&#x201d; in Brussels. A precocious anarchist firebrand, young Victor was sentenced to five years in a French penitentiary in 1912. Exiled to Spain in 1917, he participated in an anarcho-syndicalist uprising&nbsp;before leaving for Russia to join the Revolution. Arriving in 1919, after a year in a French concentration camp, Serge joined the Bolsheviks and worked in the press services of the Communist International in Petrograd, Moscow, Berlin, and Vienna. An outspoken critic of Stalin, Serge was expelled from the Party and jailed in 1929. Released&nbsp;and living in Paris, he managed to publish three novels (Men in Prison, Birth of Our Power, and Conquered City) and a history (Year One of the Russian Revolution). Arrested again in Russia and deported to Central Asia in 1933, he was allowed to leave the USSR in 1936 after international protests by militants and prominent writers like Andr� Gide and Romain Rolland. Using his insider&#x2019;s knowledge, Serge published a stream of impassioned, documented expos�s of Stalin&#x2019;s Moscow show trials and machinations in Spain, which went largely unheeded. Stateless, penniless, hounded by Stalinist agents, Serge lived in precarious exile in Brussels, Paris, Vichy France, and Mexico City, where he died in 1947. His classic Memoirs of a Revolutionary and his great last novels, Unforgiving Years and The Case of Comrade Tulayev (both available as NYRB Classics), were written &#x201c;for the desk drawer&#x201d; and published posthumously.<br> Richard Greeman, the translator of four of Victor Serge&#x2019;s novels, has written a doctoral dissertation about Serge along with numerous other studies of his work and life. He blogs at Z-Space (www.zcommunications.org/zspace/rgreeman) and his <i>Beware of &#x201c;Vege</i>tarian&#x201d; Sharks!: Radical Rants and Internationalist Essays (Illustrated) was published by Praxis in 2007.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Legacy of William Carey: A Model for the Transformation of a Culture</h2><p><p>He was an industrialist. An economist. A medical humanitarian. A media pioneer. An educator. A moral reformer. A botanist. And a Christian missionary. And he did more for the transformation of the Indian subcontinent in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries than any other individual before or since.</p> <p>Many know of William Carey. Some know about the specifics of his work and ministry. But few understand the profound contemporary significance of his life. Few realize how much we owe the increasing globalization of Christianity to the silent revolution he initiated. Fewer still are aware of his legacy of sensitivity to the variety of issues confronting true gospel witness in any culture.</p> <p>This biography about the central character in the story of India's modernization and transformation will help you understand Carey's impact. But <em>The Legacy of William Carey</em> is more than a biography. It is a charge to all Christians to respond in kind within our own cultures, and to use Carey's example as our model for taking the light of the Gospel into every corner of society. If we follow in his footsteps, not only will lives be bettered this side of heaven, but hearts will be changed for eternity--and entire cultures transformed for Christ.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Ascent of Rum Doodle</h2><p>An outrageously funny spoof about the ascent of a 40,000-and-a-half-foot peak, The Ascent of Rum Doodle has been a cult favorite since its publication in 1956. Led by the reliably under-insightful Binder, a team of seven British men including Dr. Prone (constantly ill); Jungle the route finder (constantly lost), Constant the diplomat (constantly arguing) and 3,000 Yogistani porters, set out to conquer the highest peak in the Himalayas.</p><p>Loosely modelled on a 1937 account of Bill Tilman&#39;s Nanda Devi expedition, The Ascent of Rum Doodle riotously parodies the familiar tropes of 1950s mountaineering literature. Bowman&#39;s intrepid cast of characters may come from all walks of life, but are similarly at a loss when it comes to their supposed specialties... Prone, the expedition&#39;s doctor, is constantly incapacitated by sudden illnesses; Jungle, charged with navigation, is forever losing his way and cabling for money from obscure locations; and Constant, who alone speaks the native language of their guides and porters, through linguistic error provokes not just one but several riots. Led by Binder, whose narration would have you believe his crew and mission to represent nothing short of historic bravery and grit, these daring incompetents cut their path to the summit (sort of).William Ernest Bowman (1912-1985) was a civil engineer and writer. He spent his free time hill-walking, painting and writing (unpublished) books on the Theory of Relativity.</p><h2>The Ethics (Dover Thrift Editions: Philosophy)</h2><p>What does it mean to live an ethical life? For seventeenth-century philosopher Benedict de Spinoza, this question led to a doctrine in which God is present in all things and the human mind is part of God's infinite intellect. Spinoza regarded ethics as a rational system corresponding to the rational nature of the universe and employed a deductive method derived from Euclidean geometry to show that the validity of ethical ideas can be demonstrated by a mathematical style argument. His conclusion: to be guided by reason is to live freely, motivated by love and goodwill rather than fear or hatred.<br> These ideas challenged both conventional views of God and the related social and political structure. Reviled by the religious authorities of his native Amsterdam, Spinoza remained an uncompromising model of intellectual courage. His vision, published posthumously as <i>The Ethics,</i> has served as an inspiration to Enlightenment philosophers, Romantic poets, and generations of thinkers.</p><p>Dutch philosopher Benedict de Spinoza (1632&#x2013;77) ranks among the 17th century's major thinkers. <i>The Ethics,</i> his magnum opus, was written between 1664 and 1665 and published posthumously in 1677. Both Jewish and Catholic authorities reviled the philosopher's focus on reason and defiance of tradition, but Hegel noted, "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all."</p><h2>The End of Words: The Language of Reconciliation in a Culture of Violence (The Lyman Beecher Lectures in Preaching)</h2><p>After the horrors and violence of the twentieth century, words can seem futile. In this reflection on the place of preaching today, Richard Lischer recognizes that our mass-communication culture is exhausted by words. Facing up to language's disappointments and dead ends, he opens a path to its true end.<br><br> With chapters on vocation, interpretation, narration, and reconciliation,&nbsp;<i>The End of Words</i>&nbsp;shows how faithful reading of Scripture rather than flashy performance paves the way for effective preaching; Lischer challenges conventional storytelling with a deeper and more biblical view of narrative preaching. The ultimate purpose of preaching, he argues, is to speak God's peace, the message of reconciliation.<br><br> While Lischer's&nbsp;<i>End of Words</i>&nbsp;will surely be invaluable to pastors and preachers, his honest, readable style will appeal to anyone concerned with speaking Christianly.</p><p>Richard Lischer is James T. and Alice Mead ClelandProfessor of Preaching at Duke Divinity School. Beforejoining the Duke faculty, he served as pastor of Lutherancongregations in Illinois and Virginia. A graduate ofConcordia Senior College and Concordia Seminary, he alsoholds an M.A. in English from Washington University in St.Louis and a Ph.D. in theology from the University ofLondon. He is the author of numerous books on preaching,theology, and ministry, including A Theology ofPreaching: The Dynamics of the Gospel and theprize-winning The Preacher King: Martin Luther King, Jr.and the Word That Moved America. He is also theco-editor (with William Willimon) of the ConciseEncyclopedia of Preaching. The story of his firstpastorate, Open Secrets: A Memoir of Faith andDiscovery, has been widely anthologized, and his mostrecent Eerdmans book, The Company of Preachers, wasnamed Best Book in ministry in 2002 by ChristianityToday. The End of Words is based on his Lyman BeecherLectures in Preaching delivered at Yale Divinity School.Professor Lischer and his wife live in Orange County, NorthCarolina.<b>Gardner C.

Neumark</b><br> "Richard Lischer's book could not be more timely. To paraphrase his own insight, this book doesn't entertain; it does something far better.

At the age of three, he came with his family to the United States and grew up in Los Angeles. He attended Los Angeles City College from 1939 to 1941, then left school and moved to New York City to become a writer. His lack of publishing success at this time caused him to give up writing in 1946 and spurred a ten-year stint of heavy drinking. After he developed a bleeding ulcer, he decided to take up writing again. He worked a wide range of jobs to support his writing, including dishwasher, truck driver and loader, mail carrier, guard, gas station attendant, stock boy, warehouse worker, shipping clerk, post office clerk, parking lot attendant, Red Cross orderly, and elevator operator. He also worked in a dog biscuit factory, a slaughterhouse, a cake and cookie factory, and he hung posters in New York City subways.<br><br>Bukowski published his first story when he was twenty-four and began writing poetry at the age of thirty-five.

Cain, who had also, unbeknownst to me, shaped the style of Camus&#x2019;s The Stranger. The book includes some of Bukowski&#x2019;s roughly drawn illustrations, which fall somewhere close to pornographic Ziggy or adult-themed New Yorker cartoons. One features an asthmatic customer at an adult bookstore asking the cashier to inflate his blow-up doll for him; another shows an expressionistically drawn party girl surrounded by gawking men with the caption 'God, a woman could get bored.'

The obvious influence is to Hemingway&#x2015;see: the title&#x2015;but perhaps more interestingly, the editor David Stephen Calonne notes Bukowski&#x2019;s debt to the crime writer James M. Cain, who had also, unbeknownst to me, shaped the style of Camus&#x2019;s The Stranger. The book includes some of Bukowski&#x2019;s roughly drawn illustrations, which fall somewhere close to pornographic Ziggy or adult-themed New Yorker cartoons. One features an asthmatic customer at an adult bookstore asking the cashier to inflate his blow-up doll for him; another shows an expressionistically drawn party girl surrounded by gawking men with the caption 'God, a woman could get bored.' The subject matter is a more amplified version of the usual Bukowski fare&#x2015;stalwart, sleazebag protagonists; spectral, deathly women with emphatically described upper legs. As always, the most one can hope for in Bukowski&#x2019;s universe is 'a grim yet comfortable isolation.'"&#x2015;Casey Henry, <em>The Paris Review</em></p><p>"Like Robert Crumb, whose art appears on the cover of <em>The Bell Tolls For No One</em>, Charles Bukowski represents a kind of brazenly counterculture spirit that holds in contempt anything that represents the Establishment. Read in this light, this newest compilation can be viewed as more than the self-admitted 'notes of a dirty old man,' but as the further works of an iconoclast who, much like the underground comics artists and punk rock bands of the late &#x2018;70s, waged war against all that was supposedly &#x2018;decent' and conventional for the sake of getting at the grit of human experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>ZYZZYVA</em></p><p>These are tales from the lower class and underclass, in all their glorious craziness and absurdity. It&#x2019;s not pretty, and yet, somehow, there is joy in reading these stories, and somehow too, Bukowski ends up being a good buddhist, finding the larger beauty in these dismal lives ... [For those] who already love Buk, this book will leave content, drunk, smiles on our faces.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Entropy Magazine</em></p><br></p><h2>Raw Energy in a Glass: 126 Nutrition-Packed Smoothies, Green Drinks, and Other Satisfying Raw Beverages to Boost Your Well-Being</h2><p><p>Boost your energy with all-natural smoothies, shakes, green drinks, power shots, and fermented beverages.

The skills, techniques and even the tools needed to complete&nbsp; these tasks are explained in&nbsp;jargon free language to ensure that even&nbsp; those enthusiasts with no previous restoration experience will feel confident in sorting out their Bus. An indispensable and unique guide for lovers of these fast appreciating classics.</p><p>Mark Paxton acquired his first VW Bus, a split screen van, nearly 30 years ago, followed by a Bay and then a few Beetles. A period without owning any of VW's iconic flat fours while running a garage dedicated to more Gallic motors was compensated for by a steady flow of friends.&nbsp;Buses to work on eased the pain. A move into classic car and motorcycle journalism was followed by the chance to intimately reacquaint himself with innermost workings of the Bay Window Transporter and write this book.<p><b>The Daily Star, 29th August 2008</b><b><br> UK newspaper<br> Circ: 655,000</b><br><br> If you've not been lucky enough to win one of our regular contest prizes of a VW Camper Van why not buy one cheap, then do it up.&nbsp; This week saw the launch of the VW Bus Enthusiasts Restoration Manual.

If you have a VW bus project, you'll find the outlay worthwhile.<br><br>Autoist, September 2008<br> Magazine for the Volkswagen Club of America<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> This book is a guide to the restoration of the 1968-1979 VW Type 2 Bus, aka the Bay Window Bus. It is generously equipped with color photographs throughout and relies mainly on these captioned photographs to convey its information via step-by-step instructions. The book is intended to supplement existing VW workshop manuals in areas that the author thought were lacking or neglected, such as bodywork. As with previous published VW restoration manuals, this author also includes a brief history of the model as well as key inspection tips (also photographed) for the prospective buyer.&nbsp; The restoration topics begin with 60 pages of text and pictures on body and chassis repair procedures &#x2013; more procedures than most VW hobbyists would have the temerity to tackle, unless they had professional welding skills and no constraints on time. It is at least helpful that generous use is made of pre-fabricated repair sections and panels in these procedures. Next is over 20 pages on door and hinge repairs, large and small, up to and including (for the brave) re-skinning your door while simultaneously replacing significant frame rot. The subject of bodywork is completed with a chapter on painting. This is an area that the experienced VW restorer will likely find to be less detailed than desirable, given that many general-purpose restoration guides already exist that cover painting tasks extensively.&nbsp; Next come chapters covering the bay window mechanical systems-front beam, rear axle, engine (but not tranny), fuel delivery and so on. Many workshop manuals, plus the line of Bug Me Videos, already cover the rebuilding of such components with detailed step-by-step procedures. By comparison, this book uses 84 pages of captioned photographs to convey what the author considers important and/or over-looked nuggets of information on these subjects.&nbsp; Accordingly, while not a standalone rebuilding guide in these areas, the novice VW restorer should find this part of the book useful in further illustrating many common repair steps. Other than a final chapter on workshop tools and techniques, the author ends the restoration topics with a subject on, which I find almost all VW workshop manuals to be sadly lacking &#x2013;&nbsp;trim and fittings. There are 24 pages of captioned photographs covering repair steps and/or useful tips on seats, door panels, headlining, floor coverings, seals, bumpers, badge and grill, wipers and so on.&nbsp; In summation, although much of this book's audience might hesitate to attempt the more complex bodywork procedures, the numerous captioned photographs on Bay Window Bus restoration still manage to convey much useful information not published elsewhere. If you plan on doing your own bus repairs, consider adding this book to your library.<br><br>"[This book] has been published in both the UK and the USA so there could be a rush on getting vehicles to work on, so you'd better get cracking right now, with this excellent manual to guide you." &#x2013; Mid Devon Star<br> -<br><br> "Extremely well illustrated throughout, with clear, straightforward, jargon-free explanations." &#x2013; New Zealand Classic Car<br></p><h2>Still Sovereign: Contemporary Perspectives on Election, Foreknowledge, and Grace</h2><p>The relationship between divine sovereignty and the human will is a topic of perennial theological dispute and one that is gaining increased attention among contemporary evangelicals.<br><br>In Still Sovereign, thirteen scholars write to defend the classical view of God's sovereignty. According to the editors, "Ours is a culture in which the tendency is to exalt what is human and diminish what is divine. Even in evangelical circles, we find increasingly attractive a view of God in which God is one of us, as it were, a partner in the unfolding drama of life. . . . In contrast, the vision of God affirmed in these pages is of one who reigns supreme over all, whose purposes are accomplished without fail, and who directs the course of human affairs, including the central drama of saving a people for the honor of his name, all with perfect holiness and matchless grace."<br><br>The fourteen chapters of Still Sovereign (originally part of the two-volume, The Grace of God, the Bondage of the Will) are divided into three parts. Part 1 offers fresh exegesis of the biblical texts that bear most directly on the doctrines of election, foreknowledge, and perseverance of the saints. Part 2 explores theological and philosophical issues related to effectual calling, prevenient grace, assurance of salvation, and the nature of God's love. The final section applies the doctrines of election and divine sovereignty to Christian living, prayers, evangelism, and preaching.</p><p><b>Thomas R.
